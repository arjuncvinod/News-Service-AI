So, as we step into 2025, we asked the expert to list five fitness-related things that you and I should ditch in the new year. Low-calorie diets Low-calorie diets provide instant results, and you don’t even require help from an expert, but everyone is realising that it’s not the best way to lose weight as it impacts your health. “At the same time, it hampers your energy, productivity, and happiness, but the biggest thing is that it destroys your metabolism,” said Nagpaul.

Here are some myths you should ditch in 2025 (Source: Getty Images/Thinkstock) Energy drinks Energy drinks are very popular. They may be good for athletes, but they’re not so important for the general population who are not exercising for long hours, as one big purpose of energy drinks is to provide energy when you are doing any physical activity for long periods, noted Nagpaul. “If you do one hour of mid-intensity workout, then you are consuming excess sugar for no reason, impacting your insulin,” he explained. Sedentary lifestyle Mobility is very important, especially in the current scenario, as most people are sedentary and often glued to their smartphones and laptops, which makes them stiff. “Mobility exercises are required to improve range of motion. So, even when not exercising, consider walking and taking frequent breaks,” said Nagpaul. General programmes General exercise and nutrition plans do more damage than one realises, cautioned Nagpaul. “There is no one program which can work for 100 percent of the people, so it’s better to do some DNA and EPI genetics testing done to understand one’s biology to get a personalised program for oneself,” said Nagpaul. 📣 For more lifestyle news, click here to join our WhatsApp Channel and also follow us on Instagram","category":"lifestyle"},{"publishedAt":"2024-12-11","title":"Rohit Sharma wears Patek Philippe watch on Australia tour; here’s how much it costs","description":"Rohit Sharma’s Aquanaut Travel Time is a contemporary and casual watch designed for frequent travellers","urlToImage":"https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/12/rohit-sharma.jpg?w=640","content":"Luxury watches have always been a status symbol, especially among celebrities and sports icons.

If you fold them and they stay that way (without springing back), it is time to discard them,” read an Instagram post by ‘Extreme Satisfying Cleaning’. However, netizens were not convinced and took to the comments section, responding with, “Girl, that was a body pillow. They are going to fold like that. The other ones are just regular pillows. They don’t fold unless you make them,” and “This doesn’t seem like a very scientific test…” One user wrote: “How to convince yourself to spend more money without seeming unreasonable”. To verify the claim, we reached out to experts. Dermatologists suggest replacing pillows every 1-2 years to maintain hygiene and skin health. Over time, pillows accumulate dust mites, dead skin cells, and oils, which can trigger allergies or skin issues, said cosmetologist Dr Karuna Malhotra, founder of Dr Karuna’s Cosmetic Skin & Homeo Clinic. She reiterated that using an old pillow can contribute to acne and skin irritation due to the buildup of bacteria and debris over time. It loses support, shape, collects allergies, looks lumpy and becomes less hygienic over time. “Even the finest pillows lose charm and can wake with an ache that’s an alarming call to dispose and use it for sustainable purpose,” said Abhaye Gupta, CEO, Rabyana. Dr Arvind Mehra, senior director, orthopaedic, Paras health Gurugram said, one could replace them sooner if they show signs of lumps, flattening, or discoloration. “Apart from dust, replacing pillows at the right time is crucial for maintaining spinal health and preventing orthopedic issues. Worn-out pillows that fail to provide proper neck and spine alignment can lead to chronic neck pain, headaches, and even long-term posture problems,” said Dr Mehra. For sustainable disposal, avoid tossing pillows into the trash, said Dr Malhotra. Instead, consider these options: Donation: If the pillow is still in good condition, donate it to homeless shelters, animal shelters, or daycare centers where they can be reused responsibly. Also Read | How often should you really be washing your bedsheets? Recycling: Some specialised programs, like those offered by textile recycling services, accept old pillows. “Research local options or consider mail-in programs for recycling,” said Dr Malhotra. Gupta agreed and shared that textile recycling centers accept synthetic filled-cushions, ensuring responsibility. “For cushions with natural stuffing like feathers, consider composting. Small steps like these can reduce waste and contribute to a greener planet, aligning with the ethos of sustainable living,” said Gupta. View this post on Instagram A post shared by Extreme Satisfying Cleaning (@extremesatisfyingcleaningig) Repurposing: Old pillows can be reused creatively — for example, as pet beds, garden kneeling pads, or stuffing for new cushions, said Dr Malhotra. “Natural-fiber pillows can also be composted if made of materials like cotton,” said Dr Malhotra. Not just the mattress, your pillow(s) is equally important.

Recently, the actor shared her struggles with neuropathic pain, a side effect of chemotherapy that has significantly impacted her daily life. In a YouTube video, Hina revealed how alternating hot and cold water therapy has provided her relief, even as she continues to endure pain. Her first trip out of town to Ahmedabad since starting chemotherapy underscored the challenges of managing symptoms like numbness in her legs. “Legs ekdum numb hojate hai, so I will rest in the hotel before I can go about the rest of the day,” Hina remarked. What is hot and cold fermentation therapy? Hot and cold fermentation therapy is a non-invasive pain management technique involving the application of warm and cold water to affected areas. According to Dr Neeraj Goel, Director – Oncology Services at CK Birla Hospital in Delhi, this method alternates between hot water (40°C) and cold water (13°C) for 15–30 minutes, two to three times a day. This therapy leverages the benefits of both temperatures: Hot water relaxes muscles, improves blood flow, and alleviates stiffness. Cold water reduces inflammation, numbs pain, and eases muscle spasms. Together, they enhance circulation, reduce swelling, and promote recovery, making them particularly effective for neuropathic pain. Neuropathic pain and chemotherapy Neuropathic pain, often caused by nerve damage or dysfunction, is a common side effect of certain chemotherapy drugs like paclitaxel and cisplatin, Dr Goel said. This pain manifests as burning, tingling, or shooting sensations, particularly in the extremities. Chemotherapy-induced neuropathy results from nerve inflammation, oxidative stress, and damage to the protective covering of nerve cells. The alternating use of heat and cold tackles multiple aspects of neuropathic pain, Dr Goel shared: Reduces oxidative stress on nerves. Promotes healing by improving oxygen and nutrient delivery to damaged tissues. Eases inflammation and muscle tension. View this post on Instagram A post shared by 𝑯𝒊𝒏𝒂 𝑲𝒉𝒂𝒏 (@realhinakhan) Additional management strategies While hot and cold therapy is effective, Dr Goel noted a comprehensive approach to managing neuropathic pain may include: Medications such as gabapentin or pregabalin. Topical treatments like lidocaine patches. Physical therapy to strengthen muscles and improve mobility. Lifestyle changes include stress management, healthy eating, and regular exercise. Precautions When using hot and cold therapy: Avoid extreme temperatures to prevent burns or frostbite. Use a towel or cloth barrier to protect your skin.

This craft is also a global phenomenon. Research suggests gourds are the oldest domesticated plants, and as you travel further into rural villages, they can often be seen hanging from huts. Farmers use them to conserve and store seeds, promoting seed sovereignty. The diversification into urban-friendly crafts is relatively recent. Farmers traditionally used gourds as vegetables and water containers, their natural properties keeping water cool during long journeys. In Madhya Pradesh, I encountered eco-friendly loofahs made from the delicious Gilki or Torai, also known as sponge gourds. Once matured and dried, these gourds that grow on vines transform into useful household items. Artisans and farmers in Tamil Nadu, and organisations like Meghalayan Age in Delhi and Krishi Kala in Karnataka support these gourd crafts, empowering women artisans to create colourful vases, jewellery, lamps, birdhouses, magazine holders, utensils, and even musical instruments like sitars and tamburis. Art from gourds strengthens the intangible cultural heritage they signify. Seed to showpiece While carving lamps or artifacts in itself is not very tedious, it is the journey of the gourd from farm to workshop that is prolonged. (Photo: Artisan Jagat Ram Dewangan) In Bastar, Chhattisgarh, gourds are crafted into Tuma or Tumba lamps, often paired with Dhokra crafts. Varieties of “ghiya” (bottle gourd) and pumpkins are intricately carved to create stunning lamp décor and lanterns. Jagatram Dewangan, an award-winning artist making Tuma lamps since 2005, stressed the need for government support, particularly in packaging, as local sales are usually low and artisans have to travel to cities to showcase these. His main income comes from exhibitions and fairs––like Saras and Surajkund––where he showcases his work. He has trained over 100 women and sources gourds from farmers who intercrop them with maize. When asked about his challenges, he said, “While carving lamps or artifacts in itself is not very tedious, it is the journey of the gourd from farm to workshop that is prolonged. The harvest occurs once a year, and we have to wait for the produce to dry. Ideally, a lamp takes a day to complete depending on the designs and patterns we want to make.” Harvest to handcrafted In the era of eco-friendly fashion, gourds offer a sustainable alternative to plastic and synthetic products. (Photo: Swasti Pachauri) The crafting process requires patience. After harvest, farmers pick the dry gourds and soak them in warm water to remove mold and skin using copper or steel scrubbers. Artisans then extract the seeds and flesh and polish the gourds, turning them into decorative items or utility products, including jewelry made from small gourds. Like many artisans, Jagatram faced challenges during the COVID-19 lockdown but received government support and a loan. “I received governmental support and a loan during COVID-19,” he said. Worldwide wonders Diversification in gourd crafts has led to the use of vibrant red, brown, and green oil paints, giving these items an aesthetic similar to Kalamkari art. Globally, particularly in parts of Africa and America, artists use gourds to depict folk tales, turning them into cultural symbols. I met Graham Ottoson in Ithaca, USA, who runs “Gourdlandia,” a sustainable farm business. Growing gourds alongside marigolds, which act as natural insect repellents, the initiative also produces the African wine kettle variety and long dipper gourds, commonly used for lamps, vases, bowls, and musical instruments. During cultural festivals and Thanksgiving, gourd crafts gain popularity. Artisan Jagat Ram Chhattisgarh working with gourds. In the era of eco-friendly fashion, gourds offer a sustainable alternative to plastic and synthetic products.

Recently, during her appearance on The Great Indian Kapil Show she spoke about the essence of true love. She expressed that in her view, true love happens only once — if you meet the right partner. During the show, Sharma humorously admitted that he’s puzzled over how poets portray love in such contradictory ways.To this, Rekha replied, “Mere khayal se agar sahi aadmi ho toh ek hi baar kaafi hai! Kitne baar, kitne aadmi karenge? (If the person is right, then falling in love once is enough)?” The veteran actor also spoke about the importance of self-love. She remarked, “Mera tazurba ye hai… main apni baat kar sakti hoon… sabse pehle toh main sab cheez se pyaar karti hoon. Kaam se, mere doston se, duniya se, nature se… lekin sabse zyaada main pyaar karti hoon khud se (As far as I am concerned, I am in love with everything. With my friends, this world, with nature… but I am most in love with myself).” Her perspective raises an age-old question: Is love really a once-in-a-lifetime experience, or is it possible to find and feel true love more than once? Psychologist Anjali Gursahaney tells indianexpress.com, “The belief that love is a ‘once-in-a-lifetime’ phenomenon is more rooted in romantic ideals and cultural narratives than in psychological research. Studies in psychology indicate that love is a complex emotion that can manifest in various forms, such as romantic love, companionate love, and self-love. While some individuals may feel that a single relationship encapsulates their ultimate experience of love, others discover meaningful connections throughout different stages of their lives, indicating that love can indeed be experienced multiple times.” Can people experience ‘true love’ with more than one partner over the course of their lives? “Yes, people can experience ‘true love’ with more than one partner,” confirms Gursahaney. The concept of true love is subjective and depends on how individuals define and perceive it. Factors like emotional depth, mutual understanding, and shared values contribute to feelings of true love, and these can be present in multiple relationships. Timing, personal growth, and compatibility are critical factors in how relationships are perceived and experienced. (Source: Freepik) Influence of factors like timing, personal growth, and compatibility Timing, personal growth, and compatibility are critical factors in how relationships are perceived and experienced. Gursahaney notes that timing affects whether two individuals are at a stage in their lives where they can commit to and nurture a deep connection. Personal growth shapes the ability to understand, communicate, and build intimacy within a relationship. “When these factors align, individuals are more likely to perceive the relationship as their ‘one true love,’ though it’s often a combination of effort, mutual respect, and shared experiences that solidify this perception,” shares Gursahaney. Advice for individuals who feel they may have missed their chance at true love Here are some steps to navigate these feelings, as mentioned by Gursahaney: Reflect and Heal: Take time to process the loss, understand your emotions, and heal from past wounds. Self-reflection helps build resilience and prepares you for future relationships. Focus on Self-Growth: Cultivate self-love, pursue personal interests, and develop skills that bring joy and fulfillment. A stronger sense of self often attracts healthier connections. Stay Open to New Opportunities: Love can come in unexpected forms and times. Remaining open to meeting new people and building connections can lead to meaningful relationships. Seek Support: Talking to friends, loved ones, or a therapist can provide perspective and emotional support as you navigate your feelings. Redefine Love: Love isn’t confined to one person or relationship. It is a continuous journey that evolves with life experiences. 📣 For more lifestyle news, click here to join our WhatsApp Channel and also follow us on Instagram","category":"lifestyle"},{"publishedAt":"2024-12-11","title":"Can having one banana a day keep the doctor away?","description":"Although fruits are healthy, they should be eaten in moderation as they contain natural sweeteners","urlToImage":"https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/09/banana_1600_freepik.jpg?w=640","content":"Fruits are a healthy way to meet the body’s need for fibre, vitamins, and other nutrients. “They are rich sources of vitamins, fibre, antioxidants, potassium, folate, carbohydrates, water, folic acid, zinc, and magnesium,” said Fauziya Ansari, dietitian, Zynova Shalby Hospital, Mumbai, adding that eating fruits regularly can make you healthy while keeping infections and health problems at bay. But, is one fruit better than the other? And is there any fruit that can compete with the apple — which is believed to keep the doctor away? Yes, said Dr Priyanka Sehrawat, neurologist, medicine and neurology (AIIMS Delhi) adding that “a banana a day can also keep the doctor away.” Also Read | Pharmacist says this fruit works ‘better than all antacids’ to treat heartburn; let’s find out According to Dr Sehrawat: *Bananas are a great prebiotic that helps produce healthy organisms in the gut. *Bananas are rich in potassium Your gut health stands to gain from consumption of banana (Source: Getty Images/Thinkstock) *Low in sodium, bananas are good for blood pressure patients. “Sugar patients can have bananas, too, but in moderation. *Banana is also a good source of fibre. *Banana don’t lead to weight gain.

While unveiling Meta’s latest AI model, Llama 3.3, his ultra-thin Bulgari watch equally shared the spotlight, leaving netizens intrigued by its design and engineering marvel. The Bulgari Octo Finissimo Ultra COSC is the thinnest mechanical watch ever made that combines innovation, precision, and luxury in a package thinner than two stacked credit cards. This groundbreaking timepiece showcases the artistry of horology and highlights the intense competition among luxury brands to push the limits of design and functionality. Its thickness of just 1.7mm sets a benchmark in watchmaking and sparks curiosity about the extraordinary processes and technology behind its creation. In an interaction with indianexpress.com, Mehul Bhagwani, a watch enthusiast and digital growth marketer, delves into the meticulous artistry and ingenuity behind this remarkable creation. View this post on Instagram A post shared by Mark Zuckerberg (@zuck) Primary challenges Bhagwani explains. “Creating something like the Octo Finissimo Ultra isn’t just about shrinking parts — it’s about completely rethinking how a watch is built. Traditional movements stack components vertically, but that approach doesn’t work in something this thin. Bulgari had to go horizontal, spreading the components across a flat plane.” “And then there’s the matter of strength,” he adds, mentioning that parts as thin as 0.1mm are inherently fragile, so every tiny piece has to be engineered to handle wear and tear. Misalignment is another risk when structural supports are minimised. Precision isn’t just important — it’s critical. How does COSC certification complicate things further? Achieving COSC certification means the watch has to keep time to within -4/ 6 seconds per day. “For a watch this thin, that’s a monumental challenge. With less material, there’s less stability, which makes the movement more sensitive to shocks, temperature changes, and general wear,” notes Bhagwani. He informs that Bulgari had to optimise the BVL Calibre 180 movement — essentially reworking how the components interact to ensure stability. “It’s micro-engineering at its finest, balancing the need for accuracy with the constraints of the ultra-thin design.” The role of materials like titanium and sapphire crystal These materials are the backbone of the Octo Finissimo Ultra, highlights Bhagwani. “Titanium is lightweight, durable, and modern-looking with its sandblasted finish. It’s the perfect choice for a case and bracelet that need to be thin but tough enough for daily wear,” he says. Sapphire crystal, used on the dial and caseback, adds scratch resistance and structural integrity without adding bulk. These materials allow the watch to be feather-light yet durable, proving that thin doesn’t mean fragile. With a thickness of just 1.7mm, it sets a benchmark in watchmaking and sparks curiosity about the extraordinary processes and technology behind its creation. (Source: Instagram/BVLGARI Official) How does such innovation affect the watch industry? Bhagwani remarks, “The Octo Finissimo Ultra is more than a technical achievement—it’s a statement. It’s forced the watchmaking world to rethink what’s possible. Other brands now have to consider how they can push boundaries in thinness, materials, and movement design.” This trend isn’t just about aesthetics, according to Bhagwani; it’s about celebrating the engineering behind minimalism. “Watches like this show that luxury isn’t just about gold and diamonds; it’s about mastery, innovation, and daring to do what hasn’t been done before,” he stresses. The Bulgari Octo Finissimo Ultra COSC isn’t just a watch. It’s a bold declaration that horology can be both art and science—and that even in something as small as a wristwatch, there’s room to break records and redefine possibilities. 📣 For more lifestyle news, click here to join our WhatsApp Channel and also follow us on Instagram","category":"lifestyle"},{"publishedAt":"2024-12-11","title":"People who are good at reading have different brains","description":"Complex abilities that require integrating information tend to benefit from a thicker cortex.","urlToImage":"https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/12/brain-1.jpg?w=640","content":"By Mikael Roll The number of people who read for fun appears to be steadily dropping. Fifty per cent of UK adults say they don’t read regularly (up from 42 per cent in 2015) and almost one in four young people aged 16-24 say they’ve never been readers, according to research by The Reading Agency. But what are the implications? Will people’s preference for video over text affect our brains or our evolution as a species? What kind of brain structure do good readers actually have? My new study, published in Neuroimage, has found out. I analysed open-source data from more than 1,000 participants to discover that readers of varying abilities had distinct traits in brain anatomy. The structure of two regions in the left hemisphere, which are crucial for language, were different in people who were good at reading. One was the anterior part of the temporal lobe. The left temporal pole helps associate and categorise different types of meaningful information. To assemble the meaning of a word such as leg, this brain region associates the visual, sensory and motor information conveying how legs look, feel and move. The other was Heschl’s gyrus, a fold on the upper temporal lobe which hosts the auditory cortex (the cortex is the outermost layer of the brain). Better reading ability was linked to a larger anterior part of the temporal lobe in the left hemisphere compared to the right. It makes sense that having a larger brain area dedicated to meaning makes it easier to understand words and, therefore, to read. What might seem less intuitive is that the auditory cortex would be related to reading. Isn’t reading mainly a visual skill? Not only. To pair letters with speech sounds, we first need to be aware of the sounds of the language. This phonological awareness is a well-established precursor to children’s reading development. A thinner left Heschl’s gyrus has previously been related to dyslexia, which involves severe reading difficulties. My research shows that this variation in cortical thickness does not draw a simple dividing line between people with or without dyslexia. Instead, it spans the larger population, in which a thicker auditory cortex correlates with more adept reading. Reading is likely to shape the structure of the left Heschl’s gyrus and temporal pole. (Source: Freepik) Why size matters Is thicker always better? When it comes to cortical structure, no, not necessarily. We know the auditory cortex has more myelin in the left hemisphere of most people. Myelin is a fatty substance that acts as an insulator for nerve fibres. It increases neural communication speed and can also insulate columns of brain cells from each other. Neural columns are believed to function as small processing units. Their increased isolation and rapid communication in the left hemisphere can be thought to enable the fast, categorical processing necessary for language. We need to know if a speaker uses the category d or t when saying dear or tear rather than detecting the exact point where the vocal folds start vibrating. According to the “balloon model” of cortical growth, the larger amount of myelin squeezes out left-hemispheric cortical areas, making them flatter but more extended. So while the left auditory cortex may be thicker in good readers, it is still thinner (but much more extended) than the corresponding right cortex. This hypothesis was corroborated in the recent research. The left hemisphere had generally larger but thinner cortical areas with a higher degree of myelin. So is thinner better, then? Again, the answer is no, not necessarily. Complex abilities that require integrating information tend to benefit from a thicker cortex. The anterior temporal lobe with its complex way of integrating information is indeed the thickest structure of all cortical areas. An underlying mechanism might be the existence of more overlapping, interacting neurons which process information more holistically. Phonology is a highly complex skill, where different sound and motor features are integrated into speech sounds. It appears to correlate with a thicker cortex in an area near the left Heschl’s gyrus. While it is unclear to what extent phonology is processed in Heschl’s gyrus, the fact that phoneticians often have multiple left Heschl’s gyri suggests it is linked to speech sounds. Clearly, brain structure can tell us a lot about reading skills. Importantly, though, the brain is malleable — it changes when we learn a new skill or practice an already acquired one. For instance, young adults who studied language intensively increased their cortical thickness in language areas. Similarly, reading is likely to shape the structure of the left Heschl’s gyrus and temporal pole. So, if you want to keep your Heschl’s thick and thriving, pick up a good book and start reading. Finally, it’s worth considering what might happen to us as a species if skills like reading become less prioritised. Our capacity to interpret the world around us and understand the minds of others would surely diminish. In other words, that cosy moment with a book in your armchair isn’t just personal – it’s a service to humanity. 📣 For more lifestyle news, click here to join our WhatsApp Channel and also follow us on Instagram","category":"lifestyle"},{"publishedAt":"2024-12-11","title":"Musician Yashraj Mukhate shares weight loss transformation pictures: ‘Kapde loose bhi ho sakte hai ye ab pata chala’","description":"\"Zindagi me kabhi itna loha nahi uthaya jitna pichle kuch mahino me utha liya,\" Yashraj Mukhate added","urlToImage":"https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/12/yashraj-mukhate_600-weight-loss.jpg?w=640","content":"Musician Yashraj Mukhate, known for his unmissable rehashes of songs and iconic dialogues, recently shared a personal update on his weight loss transformation.

But then comes up a new trend, and the latest is a combination of curd and coffee for tan removal. Now, before you say ‘what?!’, let’s take you through what’s trending. Content creator Dhruv Sethi shared that it has been “2 weeks” of him constantly applying this mixture and massaging it for 4-5 minutes every night after washing his face with a cleanser. “I can see visible results in just 2-to 3 days. Not only is my skin colour lighter but my skin also feels more soft and plumped than ever,” said Sethi. Curd is proven to lighten your skin tone, and coffee adds more effect to it. “Do try this for 2-3 days at least,” Sethi added. So, we turned to Dr Jatin Mittal, co-founder, cosmetologist, and skin expert, Abhivrit Aesthetics New Delhi to decode this trend. Speaking to indianexpress.com, he said, “Coffee and curd (yoghurt) is often used in homemade skincare remedies, and they can help with skin brightening to some extent.” Coffee: Coffee contains antioxidants and caffeine, which can help improve blood circulation and reduce puffiness, making your skin appear brighter and more refreshed. It also has exfoliating properties, which can help remove dead skin cells, leading to a more radiant complexion. Do you often apply curd? (Source: Getty Images/Thinkstock) Curd: Curd is rich in lactic acid, which can help exfoliate the skin gently, removing dead skin cells and promoting a brighter, more even complexion. It also has moisturising properties, which can leave the skin feeling soft and hydrated.

It takes time. But once you start eating well and have done it for a long time, you cannot unsee the dividends,” Chhetri told ANI. His thoughts were reflected by podcaster Raj Shamani, whose reel on keystone habits has gone viral on social media. “Keystone habits theory says that some habits have a ripple effect; they improve one area of your life and end up helping in other areas, too. For example, reading every morning makes you wake up early, stay disciplined, and start your day right. You don’t have to fix everything at once. Focus on one good habit, and it’ll naturally help you grow in other parts of your life,” he shared on his YouTube channel. We decided to learn more about this theory and how it applies to everyday life. Saurabh Bothra, founder of Habuild and a certified yoga instructor, affirmed that it is a “super easy” way to start and develop good habits. “The basis of keystone habits is easy: you use small choices to create a ripple effect. As soon as you build a habit, you build a routine. Once this routine starts working for you, everything else will fall into place,” said Bothra. How does this work? Pick a habit that you can easily maintain and enjoy, too. “Your healthy habit has to encourage more positive choices – and with these choices, your lifestyle will soar,” added Bothra. What does your plate look like?

When you eat healthy, you will look physically fit. The stability of a routine will give you mental clarity, too. More than that, your small wins will keep you on track and help you build a healthier life,” explained Bothra.

But, according to various studies, there is an association between polluted air and metabolic health, too, stressed Dr Manjusha Agarwal, senior consultant, internal medicine, Gleneagles Hospital Parel Mumbai. “Particulate matter (pm) and toxic gases are known to increase inflammation and oxidative stress, disrupting the delicate balance of the endocrine system. This is known to cause impaired insulin, leading to insulin sensitivity and abnormal blood sugar levels requiring timely attention,” said Dr Agarwal. Insulin sensitivity refers to how effectively the body’s cells respond to insulin, a hormone essential for regulating blood sugar levels. “Reduced insulin sensitivity, or insulin resistance, can lead to metabolic disorders like type 2 diabetes. The World Health Organization reports that over 347 million people globally are affected by diabetes, with more than 80 per cent of related deaths taking place in low and middle-income countries,” said Dr Parjeet Kaur, associate director, endocrinology and diabetes, Medanta, Gurugram. While genetic, dietary, and lifestyle factors are well-known contributors, emerging research highlights the significant role of environmental factors, particularly air pollution, in impairing insulin sensitivity, added Dr Kaur, further mentioning that long-term exposure to air pollution is associated with the “odds of insulin resistance.” While epidemiological evidence suggests that exposure to ambient air fine particulate matter (PM2.5) increases the risk of developing type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease, experts contend that the mechanisms “underlying these effects of PM2.5 remain unclear as more accurate studies are required”, according to Dr Manisha Mendiratta, associate director and head – pulmonology, Sarvodaya Hospital, Sector-8, Faridabad. Nevertheless, it is essential to check health parameters if you already have pre-existing conditions like pre-diabetes or diabetes, said Dr Kaur. “It is also important to understand that oxidative stress is the major contributing factor by which air pollution leads to diabetes,” said Dr Agarwal. Air pollution affects your metabolic health (Express Photo by Amit Mehra) What can help? Air pollution’s impact on insulin sensitivity extends beyond inflammation to include the harmful effects of endocrine disruptors. “While avoiding exposure entirely may not be feasible, taking proactive steps to limit exposure and support metabolic health can help mitigate its effects and lower the risk of diabetes,” said Dr Abhijit Bhograj, consultant, endocrinologist, diabetes and thyroid, Manipal Hospital Hebbal. According to Dr Mendiratta, long-term air pollution exposure was associated with decreased insulin sensitivity among adults and youth, patients with diabetes, and individuals prone to type 2 diabetes, suggesting impaired insulin sensitivity could be an important intermediate step linking air pollution to developing type 2 diabetes. Check blood sugar levels regularly as recommended by the doctor. “It is essential to maintain an optimum weight, eat a nutritious diet, exercise daily, and avoid junk, oily, canned, processed, and sugary foods,” said Dr Agarwal. Also Read | This is what a body ‘heading towards diabetes’ looks like Dr Bhograj advised avoiding outdoor activities during high-pollution periods, especially in areas with heavy traffic. “Use high-quality air purifiers at home to minimise indoor exposure to harmful particles and endocrine disruptors,” said Dr Bhograj. Regular physical activity, a diet rich in antioxidants, and maintaining a healthy weight can counteract some of the negative effects of pollution on insulin sensitivity, mentioned Dr Bhograj. Since diabetes is known to impact one’s kidney, eyes, liver, and heart, it is better to go for regular check-ups and follow-ups with the doctor without fail, urge experts.

For the first time, the couple appeared together for an interview in India TV’s show Aap Ki Adaalat where they spoke about their marriage. The couple’s playful banter highlighted their close bond and easy camaraderie. During the interaction, Chadha, an AAP (Aam Aadmi Party) MP, joked, “We are happily married… she is happy and I am married. Dekhiye hum samjhauta kar lete hain… main apni galti qabool leta hu, yeh mere se sehmat ho jaati hai ki aapki galti thi, bas sab problem thik ho jaati hai (See, we compromise — I admit my mistakes, and she agrees that it was my fault. And just like that, all problems are resolved).” He further remarked, “Mujhe aisa lagta hai ki humari shaadi achchi chal rahi hai aur achchi isiliye chal rahi kyunki mujhe Bollywood ka B bhi nahi aata aur isse politics ka P bhi nahi aata. Isiliye humari gaadi badi achchi chal rahi hai” (I think that our marriage is going well because I don’t know even the ‘B’ of bollywood and she doesn’t have any clue about the ‘P’ of politics),” highlighting their distinct worlds and how love connects them despite professional differences. “Mujhe inki awaaz acchi lagti hai, toh ye jitna bhi bolti hai, mujhe accha hi lagta hai (I love the sound of her voice, so no matter how much she talks, I always enjoy it),” Chadha added. This raises an interesting question: Is it necessary to deeply understand your partner’s profession to make a relationship work, or is love and mutual respect enough? Gurleen Baruah, an existential psychotherapist at That Culture Thing, explains that while it’s not necessary for partners to fully understand each other’s professions, recognising the value it brings to the relationship can deepen emotional intimacy. “Taking the time to learn a little about what your partner does allows you to glimpse the world through their eyes — what excites them, what frustrates them, and what gives their daily life a sense of purpose,” she says. Engaging with each other’s work through questions or thoughtful conversations sends a powerful message: “I see you, I’m interested in you, and I care about the things that matter to you.” Partners don’t need to know every detail of each other’s work but should cultivate a basic understanding of its values, motivations, and challenges. (Source: Freepik) Can not understanding a partner’s career lead to challenges? How to overcome them? Baruah explains that the impact of not understanding a partner’s career depends on the couple’s dynamics. For some, it’s not an issue, while for others, it may lead to challenges, especially when one partner works in a demanding field like entertainment, with late hours and irregular schedules. Without understanding these demands, “a partner might feel neglected or undervalued, which can strain the relationship,” she says. The key challenge, she notes, often comes from misaligned expectations. If one partner doesn’t grasp the gravity of the other’s responsibilities or the reasons behind their stress and exhaustion, it can lead to frustration or feelings of being unsupported. “Overcoming these challenges requires open and honest communication,” Baruah adds. Discussing schedules, pressures, and motivations fosters understanding, even if every detail isn’t known. Flexibility and empathy are crucial. Ultimately, Baruah says, “It’s about finding a balance that works for both people,” with empathy and mutual respect helping couples navigate these challenges and grow stronger. Benefits to maintaining separate professional worlds within a marriage or relationship Baruah explains that the benefits of maintaining separate professional worlds depend on a couple’s values and how much understanding each other’s work matters to their dynamic. She notes that having distinct careers can preserve individuality and reduce work-related conflicts, while also offering freedom for personal growth without feeling scrutinised. However, she questions, “How sustainable is this over time?” Without some understanding of a partner’s profession, separation could eventually feel isolating or lead to misunderstandings.

The campaign also introduced a new ‘de-stress leave policy,’ offering six days of paid leave and complimentary spa sessions to support employee well-being. (Source: LinkedIn/YesMadam) While companies like YesMadam grapple with the balance between addressing stress and promoting their brand, it’s important to recognise that stress itself can become addictive, trapping individuals in a cycle of overwork and burnout. If you’re constantly driven to work, unable to disconnect, or feel most productive when overwhelmed, you may be experiencing stress addiction. Dr Arun Kumar, senior consultant psychiatrist at Cadabams Mindtalk, tells indianexpress.com, “Stress addiction refers to a behavioural pattern where individuals constantly seek or remain in stressful situations, even when they don’t need to. The term suggests a dependence on stress, similar to other addictions like gambling or substance abuse. People addicted to stress often thrive in high-pressure environments, and they may struggle to relax or find themselves restless when life is calm.” Why it occurs From a psychological standpoint, Dr Kumar says, stress addiction occurs because of the body’s response to stress. “When stressed, your body releases adrenaline and cortisol, the ‘fight-or-flight’ hormones that temporarily boost energy and focus. In the short term, this response can feel invigorating or even pleasurable as you feel more alert, productive, and capable of handling intense situations. Over time, however, you may begin to seek out or create stressful scenarios to maintain this ‘high’.” 5 signs you may be addicted to stress 1. You constantly seek out high-pressure situations If you find yourself always taking on more work, volunteering for demanding tasks or procrastinating until the last minute just to feel the rush of getting something done, you might be addicted to stress. Many people who are addicted to stress thrive on the urgency and excitement that stressful situations bring. 2. You struggle to relax People with stress addiction often find it difficult to unwind, even in calm environments. Whether it’s a vacation or a quiet evening at home, they may feel uneasy or bored without the adrenaline rush of stress. Instead of relaxing, they might check work emails, create new projects, or find reasons to worry. 3. Your body feels constantly on-edge Chronic stress can manifest in physical symptoms, even when you’re not consciously aware of it. This might include muscle tension, headaches, digestive issues, or difficulty sleeping. If you constantly feel a sense of nervous energy or can’t seem to calm down fully, your body might be stuck in a heightened state of arousal due to stress addiction. 4. You have emotional highs and lows Since stress triggers the release of adrenaline and cortisol, your emotions may become dependent on these hormones. You might feel a “crash” after a stressful event and crave the next surge of adrenaline. This cycle can lead to emotional instability, where you’re either riding a high from the stress or feeling drained and emotionally exhausted afterward. 5. You feel overwhelmed, yet can’t say no One of the hallmark signs of stress addiction is the inability to set boundaries. You might feel overwhelmed by your commitments, yet you continually take on more responsibilities. Saying ‘no’ becomes difficult because you’ve become accustomed to the pace and intensity of constant stress, even if it’s burning you out. One of the hallmark signs of stress addiction is the inability to set boundaries. You might feel overwhelmed by your commitments, yet you continually take on more responsibilities. (Source: Freepik) How to break the cycle The first step in breaking any addiction is recognising that it exists, says Dr Kumar. He adds, “Developing mindfulness and relaxation techniques can help retrain your brain to thrive without stress. Practices like meditation, deep breathing exercises, and yoga can help activate the parasympathetic nervous system.” One of the hardest yet most crucial steps in breaking the cycle of stress addiction is learning to say no. Setting clear boundaries around your time and energy can prevent you from falling into high-pressure situations unnecessarily. Sometimes, Dr Kumar notes, breaking the cycle of stress addiction requires professional intervention. “A therapist can help you identify the underlying causes of your addiction to stress.” 📣 For more lifestyle news, click here to join our WhatsApp Channel and also follow us on Instagram","category":"lifestyle"},{"publishedAt":"2024-12-11","title":"Chef Vikas Khanna’s New York restaurant wins Michelin 2024 Bib Gourmand Award: ‘Like a promise to my land, my people’","description":"Find out what makes Bib Gourmand Award different from a Michelin Star","urlToImage":"https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/12/vikas-bib_2.jpg?w=640","content":"Chef Vikas Khanna added another feather in his cap by winning the Michelin 2024 Bib Gourmand Award for his New York restaurant Bungalow.

Choices we make in the name of relaxation or celebration may leave lasting impressions on our health, often going unnoticed until it’s too late. The silent yet significant role of alcohol drinking is now sparking renewed attention, urging us to rethink its influence on our well-being. Dr Cyriac Abby Philips, popularly known as “The Liver Doc,” recently went viral for a post comparing the livers of two individuals—a regular weekend drinker and his wife, a healthy liver donor. The image, showing the stark difference between the drinker’s spotted, dark liver and the donor’s pink, healthy liver, sent shockwaves across the internet, reigniting discussions about the dangers of alcohol consumption. Dr Philips’ post explained that even seemingly moderate alcohol consumption can severely damage the liver over time. He wrote, “Hello. Just wanted to show the inside of the liver of a 32-year-old, ‘weekends only’ alcohol drinking man, and the healthy donor liver of his wife that he received, that will help him survive to see their little daughter grow up.” Weekend drinking may appear harmless, but it can trigger liver damage due to the cumulative stress on the organ over time (Source: X/Liverdoc) Dr Srinivas Bojanapu, a liver transplant surgeon at Kauvery Hospitals, explains that alcohol, even in moderate amounts, acts as a toxin to the liver. The organ metabolises alcohol, producing carcinogenic byproducts and depleting resources needed for other bodily functions. The effects of alcohol vary depending on several factors, including: Rate of Consumption: The speed at which alcohol is consumed influences its concentration in the bloodstream (Blood Alcohol Concentration or BAC). Genetic Predisposition: Variations in enzymes like alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) and aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH2) affect alcohol metabolism. Lifestyle Factors: Diet, age, smoking, and even the time of day can impact alcohol’s effect on the body. Weekend drinking may appear harmless, but it can trigger liver damage due to the cumulative stress on the organ over time. While it is possible for severe liver damage to result from weekend drinking, assessing alcohol consumption retrospectively is challenging, said Dr Bojanapu. People often underestimate or misreport their drinking habits. Factors like individual susceptibility, genetic variations, and coexisting health conditions also play a role in determining the extent of liver damage. Should you avoid alcohol altogether? The consensus among medical professionals is clear: the best way to protect your liver is to avoid alcohol altogether. While occasional consumption may not harm everyone equally, the unpredictability of how alcohol affects different individuals makes abstinence the safest option. Moreover, staying away from alcohol also reduces the risk of other severe health conditions, including cancer, heart disease, and neurological disorders.

Ask her if she misses playing her character on the show — Chandramukhi Chautala — and pat comes the reply: “Absolutely…she was unapologetically real, just like me.” The actor spoke to indianexpress.com on the sidelines of the Crime Literature Festival in Dehradun, talking more about her journey and why she no longer enjoys television. During the interaction, she also opened up about her fitness routine, becoming a yogini, and becoming an entrepreneur. Read the edited excerpts below. Q: Did you recently announce your decision to quit TV? Kavita Kaushik: No, I haven’t said anything like that. I said that I don’t enjoy the regressive content on television. I’ve reached a stage where I feel responsible for the kind of work I do. Shows like Naagin, Chudail, or saas-bahu dramas don’t appeal to me. Television hasn’t evolved much in the past 10-15 years, and I don’t find the current offerings exciting. I was fortunate to do FIR for 10 years. It gave me creative satisfaction. Unless it’s something challenging or a guest appearance, I wouldn’t commit to the long, exhausting hours that TV demands. Q: You’re best remembered for playing Chandramukhi Chautala. Do you miss being her? If yes, what was the best thing about it? Kavita Kaushik: Absolutely! Chandramukhi Chautala is like my alter ego. What I miss most is her limitless energy and her freedom to do anything. At times, I felt my real personality was overshadowed by hers. The love and admiration I’ve received make it all worth it. Even today, young kids are introduced to FIR by their parents, which speaks volumes about the character’s impact. Q: What made Chandramukhi Chautala strike a chord with the audience? Kavita Kaushik: Her authenticity. She was unapologetically real, just like me. I speak my mind, which sometimes works in my favour and sometimes doesn’t. Chandramukhi’s rawness and her commanding personality resonated deeply with the audience. Q: Did you ever feel that Chandramukhi’s portrayal belittled cops? Kavita Kaushik: Not at all. We never showed cops in a negative light. In fact, I’ve always respected the uniform. For 10 years, I refused offers worth lakhs to perform or attend events in a police uniform because I didn’t want to disrespect it. Q: You’re a certified yogini. Tell us about your fitness routine. Kavita Kaushik: My fitness routine is simple. I avoid eating out and focus on home-cooked meals. When I feel I’ve gained weight, I get back to working out.

Kavita Kaushik: If you see someone doing yoga with heavy makeup, don’t take it seriously. Yoga isn’t about glamour but mindfulness, connecting with your inner self, and achieving oneness with divine energy. It’s more than physical postures; it’s about creating positive energy through asanas and dhyana.

Kavita Kaushik: The best part is people’s immense love and appreciation. The worst part is that people often forget you’re human and expect you to be perfect always. They tend to ignore that you, too, have flaws and bad days. View this post on Instagram A post shared by Kavita Kaushik (@ikavitakaushik) Q: What’s in the pipeline for your homemade beauty brand? Kavita Kaushik: I’m very proud of my brand. My husband and I are working on several new products that will soon be available nationwide and internationally. You can explore them on our website. Q: Does being an actor and being constantly in the limelight affect mental health? Kavita Kaushik: Yes, being in the spotlight comes with challenges, and it can affect mental health. It’s important to stop ridiculing people who are struggling. Mental health is serious; anyone acting unusually might be dealing with real issues.

Among various fasting schedules, two common approaches stand out: skipping breakfast and skipping dinner. While both involve skipping meals for a certain period, the timing of the fast can influence the body in different ways. Some claim that skipping breakfast helps with a more efficient start to the day, while others swear by skipping dinner to avoid nighttime cravings and support better sleep. However, the effects of these fasting methods vary, depending on individual goals and lifestyle. To understand which option might be more beneficial, indianexpress.com consulted an expert. How does skipping breakfast differ from skipping dinner in terms of metabolism and energy levels throughout the day? Kanikka Malhotra, consultant dietician and certified diabetes educator, shares, “From a physiological standpoint, skipping breakfast and dinner have distinct metabolic impacts. Skipping breakfast disrupts the body’s morning metabolic reset, leading to decreased insulin sensitivity, reduced energy expenditure, and potential metabolic slowdown. This can trigger compensatory overeating later and impair cognitive function.” Conversely, Malhotra adds that skipping dinner may trigger longer overnight fasting periods, potentially enhancing metabolic autophagy and insulin sensitivity. However, it can also cause evening energy crashes, disrupt sleep hormones, and potentially lead to muscle catabolism. “Breakfast skipping tends to have more pronounced negative metabolic consequences compared to dinner skipping, primarily due to its impact on daily metabolic programming and energy regulation,” she mentions. Skipping breakfast can trigger significant psychological distress related to appetite and cravings. (Source: Freepik) How does the timing of the fast affect the body’s ability to burn fat or regulate blood sugar levels? The timing of fasting can significantly influence fat oxidation and glycemic control. “Morning fasting typically occurs when glycogen stores are depleted, potentially enhancing fat burning and insulin sensitivity. The body’s morning hormonal environment, characterised by elevated cortisol and growth hormone, can optimise lipolysis,” notes Malhotra. Evening fasting, conversely, occurs after daily energy expenditure, potentially reducing metabolic efficiency. Late-day fasting may disrupt circadian rhythms and decrease insulin sensitivity. “Research suggests morning fasting might be more effective for metabolic health, as it aligns with the body’s natural metabolic peak and can improve glucose regulation and fat metabolism more effectively than evening fasting periods,” she says. Psychological impacts of skipping breakfast versus skipping dinner Skipping breakfast can trigger significant psychological distress related to appetite and cravings. Without morning nutrition, individuals often experience heightened hunger hormones like ghrelin, leading to increased impulsive eating and potential overeating later in the day. This disruption can cause mood fluctuations, reduced cognitive focus, and increased stress, highlights Malhotra. She continues, “Conversely, skipping dinner may generate different psychological responses, potentially causing evening anxiety, sleep disruption, and persistent thoughts about food. The psychological impact varies by individual, but breakfast skipping tends to create more pronounced appetite dysregulation, as it interrupts the body’s initial metabolic signaling and can lead to more intense food preoccupation throughout the day.” ALSO READ | Tech millionaire Bryan Johnson says he fasted on LA to Bombay flight for 33 hours to prevent jet lag; find out if it really helps Specific health conditions or lifestyle factors that might make one fasting method more beneficial than the other For individuals with specific health conditions, the timing of fasting can have nuanced implications. Malhotra informs, “Diabetics might benefit more from morning fasting, as it can enhance insulin sensitivity during the day. Those with metabolic syndrome could see improved glucose regulation. Shift workers or individuals with irregular sleep patterns might find evening fasting less disruptive.” The dietician mentions that people with high morning cortisol levels or stress-related conditions could experience better hormonal balance by skipping evening meals. Athletes and individuals with high morning energy demands might find breakfast skipping counterproductive. “Individuals with digestive issues like GERD might prefer morning fasting to reduce nighttime acid reflux. Personalised approaches considering individual metabolic profiles, lifestyle, and underlying health conditions are crucial,” says Malhotra.

Books, podcasts, TikToks and digital guides implore us to donate our money cautiously, rationally, to the charities that promise to make a dollar go the furthest it can. Holiday season giving can start to feel a little like sports betting: It doesn’t matter if you’re loyal to a scrappy local team; the data can tell you exactly where your money should go. This is not how I thought about charity when I was growing up. I remember my childhood neighbor declaring that when he rode the subway, he sometimes found himself spending more than he would on a cab, because he did not believe in toughening his heart toward people asking for change. This seemed like an approach that made up for impracticality with grace: When people in front of you say they need help, do not look away. What is the right way to give away money, anyway? The debate has been fomented partly by a group of billionaires — most prominently Facebook co-founder Dustin Moskovitz and his wife, Cari Tuna — whose approach to charity argues, essentially, that you do not get to feel good for having done anything at all. People should give wherever their money is most needed and most likely to yield the biggest effects. Moskowitz and Tuna are among the Silicon Valley billionaires who have embraced the philosophical movement known as effective altruism, or EA, a worldview that focuses on optimizing good. Elon Musk, founder of Tesla and SpaceX, said effective altruist thinking closely aligned with his views. Skype co-founder Jaan Tallinn also supported the movement, and former board members of OpenAI had ties to it as well. For billionaires who made their money by crunching numbers, EA extends that into the way they give away their money, too. It is a data-loving engineer’s mode of do-gooding, for the first generation of ultrawealth created by engineers. It’s an approach that can give people moral permission to keep amassing more wealth — as long as they give some of it away. EA fits comfortably into an era of widening inequality, as the fortunes of the world’s richest have grown, along with their ability to shape ideas for the rest of us. EA applied the sheen of goodwill (altruism) to a brand of thinking (optimization) that had already taken over the way we eat and exercise, work and live. And just as health optimization began as a tech-world obsession that trickled down to the rest of us, something similar has happened in recent years with the ethos of EA and Americans’ sensibility around charitable giving. There is nothing wrong, of course, with wanting to do the most good possible. But it’s also worth asking if some charity should be reserved for causes outside optimization — extending the deepest sources of meaning in our own lives toward others and strengthening the communities we are part of. We may consider whether there’s really a one-size-fits-all template to answer a question that’s as old as Scripture and as ever-shifting as global news. Surrounded by problems that need attention, how should a person try to do good? Efficient Philanthropy Before EA became the dominant way to think about charity, it was something more modest: an essay. Philosopher Peter Singer, in 1972, published “Famine, Affluence and Morality,” which rocked readers with a simple plea: If there’s anything a person can do to alleviate the suffering of someone on the other side of the globe, Singer argued, you have a responsibility to help. In the decades since Singer’s landmark essay, EA went from being a philosophical idea to a movement to a multibillion-dollar philanthropy. Moskovitz and Tuna pledged billions of dollars of their Facebook money to the movement, through Open Philanthropy, a funder based in the San Francisco Bay Area that uses empirical research to guide charitable spending. For all the affluent people who have taken up the EA mantle, criticisms of the movement have also multiplied. Skeptics point out that it frays people’s already threadbare ties to local charities such as soup kitchens and shelters, worsening civic isolation. A billionaire pledging to do “the most good” with his or her fortune can also provide a justification for having that fortune to begin with, no matter how it was acquired. And channeling money only toward causes with measurable impact can undermine funding for squishier sources of good. “Effective altruists reduce value to anything that can be quantified, but you very often cannot quantify the things we value the most,” said Amy Schiller, author of “The Price of Humanity: How Philanthropy Went Wrong — and How to Fix It.” She rattled off some examples of things whose value was hard to price: museums, libraries, parks. Magnificent Giving When Notre Dame Cathedral caught on fire in 2019, affluent people in France rushed to donate to repair the beloved national landmark. Singer wrote an essay questioning the donations, asking: How many lives could have been saved with the charitable funds devoted to repairing this landmark? This was when a critique of EA crystallized for Schiller. “He’s asking the wrong question,” she recalled thinking at the time. She wanted to know: How could anyone put a numerical value on a holy space? Schiller had first become uncomfortable with EA while working as a fundraising consultant. She encountered donors who told her, effectively, “I’m looking for the best bang for my buck.” They just wanted to know their money was well spent. That made sense, although Schiller couldn’t help but feel there was something missing in this approach. It turned the search for a charitable cause into an exercise of bargain hunting. The school of philanthropy that Schiller now proposes focuses on “magnificence.” In studying the literal meaning of philanthropy — “love of humanity” in Greek — she decided we need charitable causes that make people’s lives feel meaningful, radiant, sacred. Think nature conservancies, cultural centers and places of worship. These are institutions that lend life its texture and color, and not just bare-bones existence. Even the CEO of the Center for Effective Altruism, Zachary Robinson, said in an interview that optimization did not dictate all his ways of doing good. He gives to effective altruist causes, but he also donates locally, supporting YIMBY Action because he is concerned about the housing crisis in his own community, San Francisco. “We don’t need to be dogmatic,” Robinson said. “I don’t think this should be the entire part of someone’s life or altruistic portfolio.” More Than Optimized Giving I’ve been talking here mostly about megaphilanthropists: Facebook billionaires and 1 percenters. But this conversation matters for the rest of us, too. With teenagers forming Luddite clubs to get off their phones, gurus publishing antiproductivity books and bestselling manifestoes teaching “How to Do Nothing,” many of us have an obvious itch to free ourselves of data: The de-optimized life is still worth living. There’s something especially raw about the impulse to disentangle optimization and charitable giving. Because unlike the calories we eat and expend, or the hours we sleep and work, charitable giving gets at what we choose to let into our hearts, what fires up our empathy and then churns it into impact. Deciding where to give means deciding what crises move us. What EA — or any school of philanthropy — offers is a set of questions. It’s a prompt to ask why we’re drawn to certain causes, why some issues elicit our sympathy and others do not, whether the groups we’d like to support are actually having any effect. It’s possible to take those questions and steer charitable choices in different directions, some optimized to save the maximum number of years of healthy life, some driven by a desire for a fairer economy or a more beautiful world. “Effective altruism brings to the surface the rationales behind giving that often were unexamined and unarticulated and often kept private,” said Benjamin Soskis, a senior research associate at the Urban Institute. “Like lots of ideologies and modes of thinking, it’s possible to find some value within it and not live your entire life devoted to those principles.” There’s nothing wrong with the desire to measure the value of our giving. But there’s also nothing wrong with thinking expansively about that value, or the tools for measuring it. Maybe a neighbor giving to another neighbor is what one fractured street needs. Maybe making someone else’s life magnificent is hard to price.

Stressing the same, nutritionist Pooja (Ajwani) Jaiswalin in a podcast highlighted the role of vitamin D in pregnancy. “No one points it out in India. Till your vitamin D is low, there is no way you can conceive. I won’t even suggest an IVF if the levels are low. Vitamin D is also connected to very low AMH levels, which helps improve fertility. So, something so basic can get missed,” Jaiswal said. Agreeing, Dr Mansi Sharma, consultant, obstetrician, and gynaecologist at Motherhood Hospital, Kharadi, said vitamin D deficiency is linked with “dysregulation of hormones,” which can impact fertility and pregnancy outcomes. Adequate vitamin D levels are crucial for a healthy pregnancy as vitamin D is necessary for the absorption and metabolism of calcium and phosphorus. “Many studies suggest a connection between low serum vitamin D levels and an increased risk of certain types of cancers, autoimmune disease, neurological disease, insulin resistance, and cardiovascular disease,” said Dr Sharma. Vitamin D is vital for various bodily functions, including calcium absorption, immune system health, and cell growth. Adequate vitamin D levels are particularly important for pregnant women to support maternal and fetal health. Dt Arti Singh, consultant nutrition and dietitian at Motherhood Hospitals Kharghar Mumbai, concurred and noted that nutritional deficiency during pregnancy, particularly vitamin D deficiency, is quite common. “Low vitamin D levels during pregnancy have been linked to increased risks of preterm birth, pre-eclampsia, gestational diabetes, and miscarriage,” said Singh. Several factors could contribute to this deficiency. These could include limited exposure to sunlight, poor dietary habits, obesity, and certain medical conditions, such as malabsorption syndromes. Singh said the normal vitamin D level during pregnancy is 30 ng/mL or higher. “By prioritising vitamin D sufficiency, you can significantly improve your chances of a healthy pregnancy and baby,” said Singh. Pregnancy needs your hormones to be sorted (Source: Freepik) Experts urge taking proactive steps to ensure adequate vitamin D levels. “Include more foods enriched with sufficient amounts of vitamin D such as vegetables, dairy products, fruits, nuts, and seeds like milk, yogurt, paneer, fatty fish, eggs, and mushrooms. Aim for at least 20 to 30 minutes of sunlight exposure daily or at least once in a while. This can help maintain mobility while keeping you refreshed,” said Dr Sharma.

Remember that vitamin D is a fat-soluble vitamin, which is best absorbed in the bloodstream with dietary fat.

The Khaleda Zia-led BNP, which used to be the principal Opposition party during Sheikh Hasina’s Awami League government in Bangladesh, called the march to protest against the breach of security at the country’s Assistant High Commission in Agartala earlier this month along with the insult of the Bangladeshi national flag and alleged incitement to communal disharmony. The protest, which started from the BNP headquarters in Naya Paltan area of Dhaka, was initially touted to be a rally till Agartala, although leaders later explained to the media that it would end at the Akhaura integrated checkpost. Speaking to reporters, Kiran Kumar, Superintendent of Police, West Tripura, said security was tightened along the border. The police and the Border Security Force have conducted joint area domination operations for the last one week. Security was beefed up at Akhaura, which hosts the second largest integrated checkpost on India’s Bangladesh border, after Petrapole-Benapole in West Bengal. “We have had an additional police checkpost here for the last couple of days. Additional security movement is going on in the area. We are conducting joint area domination and joint patrolling in the bordering areas and bordering community areas,” Kumar said. Kumar added that security was tightened along the Indo-Bangla border in view of the plenary session of the North Eastern Council scheduled to be held at Agartala on December 20 and 21, with Union Home Minister Amit Shah and Development of North Eastern Region Minister Jyotiraditya Scindia along with the governors and chief ministers of all eight Northeast states slated to attend it. Speaking to indianexpress.com, the police officer said there is no tension along the border and that the situation is peaceful. Officials also said Bangladeshi border security authorities had stopped the Agartala-bound procession from their side at Akhaura. In the aftermath of Sheikh Hasina’s ouster in an uprising in August, tensions rose in India especially after the tricolour was seen stepped on by people at a university in Bangladesh and Hindu monk Chinmoy Krishna Das was arrested there on sedition charges, triggering a wave of protests in Agartala.

So fresh of the trip, he was able to give us a thorough briefing. All the important questions that you can imagine were asked by the MPs,” the committee’s chairperson and senior Congress MP Shashi Tharoor told reporters after the meeting. Misri briefed the panel on the subject ‘Future of India-Bangladesh Relationship’. “There was a good 21-22 MP turnout and a lot of questions were asked and the Foreign Secretary answered comprehensively,” he said. Sources said several MPs asked Misri about the status of former Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina’s stay in India. However, Misri’s reply to the queries was not immediately known. Misri is also understood to have told the panel that contrary to media reports, Bangladesh’s interim government head Muhammad Yunus did not talk about review of any bilateral agreements with India. Tharoor is said to have asked Misri about the possibility of MPs going to Bangladesh. The possibility of the panel visiting Bhutan was also explored during the meeting. India had on Monday flagged “regrettable incidents” of attacks on the minorities in Bangladesh at a meeting in Dhaka between the foreign secretaries of the two countries, where Dhaka called it “misleading and false information” and said no country should interfere in its internal affairs. Misri had told reporters that he conveyed India’s concerns, including those related to the safety and welfare of minorities, during his meeting with his counterpart Mohammad Jashim Uddin. This was the first foreign secretary-level meeting between New Delhi and Dhaka after the fall of the Sheikh Hasina government on August 5 following massive protests against her government. “We also discussed some regrettable incidents of attacks on cultural, religious, and diplomatic properties,” Misri had said. “We expect, overall, a constructive approach on all these issues by the Bangladesh authorities and we look forward to moving the relationship forward in a positive, forward-looking, and constructive direction,” he added. India has repeatedly expressed concern over the targeting of Hindus since the interim government of Muhammad Yunus took charge in early August.","category":"india"},{"publishedAt":"2024-12-11","title":"EU envoy meets Rahul; bilateral ties discussed","description":"Delphin also put out pictures from the meeting on his official X handle.","urlToImage":"https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/12/feature-image-87.jpg?w=640","content":"Ambassador of the European Union to India Hervé Delphin and Leader of Opposition in the Lok Sabha Rahul Gandhi Wednesday discussed topics relevant to the relations and future of their democracies in a world marked by challenges, geopolitical tensions and crises.

China’s domestic tourism expenditure expanded by 17 per cent per year over the past decade and pushed global emissions up by 0.4 gigatonnes, followed by domestic tourism in the US (0.2 gigatonnes) and India (0.1 gigatonnes), the study, published in the journal Nature Communications, found. Rising income levels, especially among the “emerging economic powerhouses of China and India”, too could be a driving factor, researchers led by those at the University of Queensland, Australia, said in the study. They tracked international and domestic travel for 175 countries during 2009-2019 and found that greenhouse gas emissions from tourism have been growing more than two times faster, compared to those from the rest of the global economy. Carbon footprint from tourism was found to have increased from 3.7 gigatonnes to 5.2 gigatonnes — with most net emissions coming from aviation, utilities and private vehicles. A rapid growth in travel demand has led to the carbon from tourism account for nine per cent of the world’s total emissions, according to corresponding author Ya-Yen Sun, an associate professor at the University of Queensland’s Business School. “Without urgent interventions in the global tourism industry, we anticipate annual increases in emissions of three to four per cent, meaning they will double every 20 years,” Sun said. The author added that the trend does not comply with the Paris Agreement, according to which the sector is required to cut its emissions by over 10 per cent every year. “The major drivers behind the increasing emissions are slow technology improvements and a rapid growth in demand,” Sun said. The authors wrote, “The net increase in tourism emissions is unevenly distributed, with growth in domestic travel in three countries — the USA, China, and India — contributing most to the absolute rise in emissions.” If the world’s top 20 highest emitting destinations had contained their tourism growth rate by one per cent a year from 2009 to 2019, about 0.38 gigatonnes of emissions could have been reduced in 2019 — representing seven per cent of the world’s tourism emissions, the team estimated.","category":"india"},{"publishedAt":"2024-12-11","title":"Govt removing roadblocks in path of youth by introducing reforms: PM Modi","description":"Interacting with the innovators during the grand finale of the 'Smart India Hackathon (SIH)', the prime minister said the youth today is developing a feeling of ownership towards finding solutions for the country's challenges.","urlToImage":"https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/12/PM-Modi-1.jpg?w=640","content":"The government is introducing reforms to remove roadblocks in the path of the country’s youth, Prime Minister Narendra Modi told young innovators on Wednesday, asserting that the future of the world will be driven by innovation and knowledge.

The prestigious award, to be presented by Tamil Nadu Chief Minister M K Stalin during the inauguration of the Vaikom Memorial Building Thursday, highlights Mahadeva’s towering contributions to literature and activism, according to a statement from the Tamil Nadu government. The Vaikom Award, instituted in 2023 to honour individuals or organisations from across India who embody the values of equality and justice, recognises Mahadeva’s extensive work in advocating for Dalit rights, his literary achievements, and his ideological synthesis of Gandhi and Ambedkar’s philosophies. The award is linked to the Vaikom Satyagraha, between 1924 to 1925, aimed at challenging caste-based restrictions on access to the Vaikom Temple in Kerala. The Satyagraha, which marked a significant step in India’s struggle against untouchability and inspired subsequent temple entry movements across the country, was backed by Mahatma Gandhi, and E V Ramasamy, or ‘Periyar’, the Tamil social reformer. Born in 1948 in Karnataka’s Devanuru village, Mahadeva has remained steadfast in his mission to uplift the lives of marginalised communities. His literary career, though modest in volume, is monumental in impact. Mahadeva’s early works, such as the short novel ‘Odalaala’ (1978) and the award-winning ‘Kusumabale’ (1988), delve into the complexities of Dalit life with an insider’s authenticity. These works earned him accolades, including the Sahitya Akademi Award and the Padma Shri, which he returned in 2015 as a protest against rising intolerance. Mahadeva is one of several literary figures in Karnataka who have faced death threats from ultra-Hindu groups, leading authorities to provide him with a security ring for his protection. His narratives traverse the intimate and the universal, focusing on survival, resilience, and the systemic forces that perpetuate inequality. Renowned critic G S Amur had written about Mahadeva’s storytelling as one capturing “a community which had melted into darkness” and framing it within larger societal issues. Mahadeva’s writing not only documents the Dalit experience but also challenges caste hierarchies through indigenous narrative forms. Mahadeva’s activism is inseparable from his literary pursuits. As a founding member of the Dalit Sangharsha Samiti (DSS), he mobilised marginalised communities in Karnataka, fighting for land rights, educational opportunities, and participatory democracy. His vision is rooted in the teachings of B R Ambedkar and Mahatma Gandhi, whose philosophies he describes as complementary forces in the struggle for justice. Ram Manohar Lohia also influenced Mahadeva’s work and activism, particularly through his advocacy for social justice, caste equality, and economic democracy. The key role he played behind DSS was inspired by Lohia’s ideals. In one of his interviews in 2018, Mahadeva said, “If we let go of logic and transform [Gandhi and Ambedkar] into energy, into a cocktail, that high could win over the world”. This perspective—embracing ethical rigour and systemic critique—has made him a unique figure in India’s intellectual landscape, bridging ideologies often seen as oppositional. Mahadeva’s literary oeuvre reflects a nuanced portrayal of caste dynamics and resistance. In ‘Odalaala’, he paints a vivid picture of a Dalit family’s daily struggles, interweaving themes of hunger, dignity, and solidarity. The novel’s portrayal of Sakavva’s family—their fleeting moments of unity and the intrusion of systemic oppression—offers a searing commentary on caste and poverty. ‘Kusumabale’, often hailed as his magnum opus, expands the narrative’s scope to include metaphysical and historical dimensions. The novel’s structure integrates dialogues between the living and the spiritual, drawing on native storytelling traditions. Critics such as Amur have compared Mahadeva’s work to that of Wole Soyinka, a distinguished Nigerian playwright, poet, and political activist, for its cultural depth and innovative form, underscoring its significance in modern Kannada literature. While Mahadeva is recognised for bringing Dalit experiences to the forefront of Kannada literature, much like how Soyinka had elevated African narratives in global literature, his explorations on temporal dimensions in storytelling is also seen akin to Soyinka’s narrative techniques that often transcend linear time, probing the scope of the characters’ struggles across different timelines. In 2022, Mahadeva published ‘RSS–Aala Mattu Agala’ (RSS – The Depth and Breadth), a 72-page critique of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS). The book, which sold several lakh copies, examined the RSS’s role in anti-conversion laws, caste hierarchies, and threats to democracy. This work was celebrated by progressive groups and the Indian opposition circle. In a 2018 interview, Mahadeva spoke candidly about his ideological influences and the challenges of alternative politics. He said the need for Indian communism to adapt to local realities, criticising its stagnation. “Indian communists need to assimilate India and find their own words and actions,” he said, advocating for a politics rooted in the country’s socio-economic context. “The more Ambedkar was trampled on, the more he sprouted in people’s minds. Today everyone wants to paint Ambedkar with their colours. If there is a betrayal inside, it’s not good for anyone,” he said in the interview, in reply to Sangh Parivar’s appropriation of Ambedkar. The Vaikom Award is accompanied by a cash prize of Rs 5 lakh, a commendation certificate, and a five metal-plated memento.","category":"india"},{"publishedAt":"2024-12-11","title":"Almost 50% of affordable housing constructed under PMAY-Urban remains unoccupied","description":"Of  9.69 lakh units of affordable, slum-rehabilitation houses built under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana-Urban so far, 4.59 lakh houses are yet to be occupied.","urlToImage":"https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/12/feature-image-81.jpg?w=640","content":"Nearly half of all the affordable housing constructed so far under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana-Urban remains unoccupied, according to the Union Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs’ submission to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Housing and Urban Affairs. The mission was launched in 2015 and meant to end in 2022, but has been extended till December 31, 2024, so that the 122.69 lakh sanctioned houses can be completed, the committee noted in its report on the PMAY tabled in Parliament on Tuesday. The scheme had four verticals—beneficiary-led construction, in-situ slum redevelopment, affordable housing in partnership and a credit-linked subsidy scheme. So far, 88.32 lakh houses have been completed. Under affordable housing in partnership, where private builders are incentivised to construct housing for Economically Weaker Sections (EWS) within their projects, out of 15.65 lakh sanctioned houses, 9.01 lakh have been completed, the report noted. About 54 per cent of them (4.89 lakh) are occupied and 46 per cent (4.12 lakh) remain unoccupied. Similarly, under the in-situ slum redevelopment vertical, where housing is constructed on or near slums to rehabilitate the residents, 67,806 of 1.84 lakh sanctioned units have been completed and 70 per cent of them (47,510) are unoccupied, the report shows. When asked about the reason for the unoccupied houses, “the Ministry, in a written reply stated that out of total 9.69 lakh completed houses under AHP and ISSR houses, about 5.1 lakh have already been occupied. Remaining houses are under process of occupancy…The broad reason for unoccupancy as informed by the States includes incomplete infrastructure, non-allotment of houses, unwillingness of allottees etc,” the report said. The ministry said that as per the guidelines of the scheme, the respective state or Union Territory government is required to provide trunk infrastructure needed for these houses from their own resources. Trunk infrastructure is a combination of things needed to make a house liveable. “The concerned State Governments have not been able to provide the same so far, resulting in unoccupancy of houses. Government of Telangana, having large number of unoccupancy of completed houses, has not been able to finalize the beneficiaries for allotment of houses,” the report said, citing the ministry’s reply. The ministry told the committee that it was regularly following up with states and UTs to ensure that the basic infrastructure is provided to the residents of AHP and ISSR projects. “States/UTs have been advised to complete the basic infrastructure facilities in AHP/ISSR projects either through their own resources or by converging with other Central/State schemes so that they may be delivered/allotted to the eligible beneficiaries in time,” it said. The committee, chaired by Telugu Desam Party MP Magunta Sreenivasulu Reddy, however, pushed the ministry to ensure that the basic infrastructure is created for the residents. “While appreciating the fact that as per PMAY-U guidelines, the trunk infrastructure is to be provided by respective State/UT Governments from their own resources, the Committee are of the opinion that unoccupancy of completed houses for whatsoever reason will defeat the very purpose of the Mission. The Committee feel that it is the Ministry’s responsibility to closely monitor the progress of housing projects, address bottlenecks in construction and allotment processes and ensure effective coordination between Central and State authorities. The Committee, therefore, desire the Ministry to coordinate with States/UTs concerned for resolution of the issues so that the intended beneficiaries can occupy the houses at the earliest,” it said. The ministry told the committee that it launched the PMAY-U 2.0 in September this year in light of the lessons learnt from the nine years of the PMAY-U. Under the PMAY-U 2.0, the target is to construct 1 crore additional urban homes in five years.","category":"india"},{"publishedAt":"2024-12-11","title":"Congress-led front wrests power from CPM in 3 local bodies in Kerala","description":"Congress leader V D Satheesan says the local body bypoll results show that Kerala’s CPM-led government faces strong anti-incumbency.","urlToImage":"https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/12/feature-image-80.jpg?w=640","content":"In bypolls held for 31 divisions/wards in various local bodies in Kerala, the Congress-led United Democratic Front has made gains and wrested three local bodies ruled by the CPM-led Left Democratic Front.

Of the 31 seats, the UDF won 17, the LDF 11 and the BJP three. The LDF, which had 15 seats before the bypolls, has lost four to the Congress and the CPM has lost power in three panchayats.

A bench of Justices B Nagarathna and Kotiswar Singh said on Tuesday, “The inclusion of Section 498A of the IPC by way of an amendment was intended to curb cruelty inflicted on a woman by her husband and his family, ensuring swift intervention by the State. However, in recent years, as there have been a notable rise in matrimonial disputes across the country, accompanied by growing discord and tension within the institution of marriage, consequently, there has been a growing tendency to misuse provisions like Section 498A of the IPC as a tool for unleashing personal vendetta against the husband and his family by a wife.” Writing for the bench, Justice Nagarathna said that “making vague and generalised allegations during matrimonial conflicts, if not scrutinised, will lead to the misuse of legal processes and an encouragement for use of arm-twisting tactics by a wife and/or her family”. The bench was hearing a plea filed by a man, his parents and three sisters-in-law against a Telangana High Court order that rejected their prayer to quash the charges against them. Quashing the FIR against them under section 498A and certain provisions of the Dowry Prohibition Act 1961, the Supreme Court said, “A bare perusal of the FIR shows that the allegations made by respondent No.2 (wife of the man) are vague and omnibus. Other than claiming that ‘her husband harassed her and that the others instigated him to do so’, she has not provided any specific details or described any particular instance of harassment. She has also not mentioned the time, date, place, or manner in which the alleged harassment occurred. Therefore, the FIR lacks concrete and precise allegations.” The bench added, “Given the facts of this case and in view of the timing and context of the FIR, we find that the wife ‘left the matrimonial house on 03.10.2021 after quarrelling with’ her husband ‘with respect to her interactions with a third person in their marriage. Later she came back to her matrimonial house assuring to have a cordial relationship’… “However, she again left the matrimonial house. When the husband ‘issued a legal notice seeking divorce on 13.12.2021, the present FIR came to be lodged on 01.02.2022 by’ the wife. Therefore, we are of the opinion that the FIR filed by the wife ‘is not a genuine complaint, rather it is a retaliatory measure intended to settle scores with her husband and his family members’.” The bench said “it is noteworthy that the woman ‘has not only deserted’ her husband ‘but has also abandoned her two children as well, who are now in the care and custody of’ the husband. The bench said the applicant’s parents and sisters-in-law “have no connection to the matter at hand and have been dragged into the web of crime without any rhyme or reason”. A perusal of the FIR would indicate that no substantial and specific allegations have been made against them other than stating that they used to instigate the husband “for demanding more dowry”, it added. The bench further said, “A mere reference to the names of family members in a criminal case arising out of a matrimonial dispute, without specific allegations indicating their active involvement, should be nipped in the bud. It is a well-recognised fact, borne out of judicial experience, that there is often a tendency to implicate all the members of the husband’s family when domestic disputes arise out of a matrimonial discord. “Such generalised and sweeping accusations unsupported by concrete evidence or particularised allegations cannot form the basis for criminal prosecution. Courts must exercise caution in such cases to prevent misuse of legal provisions and the legal process and avoid unnecessary harassment of innocent family members.” The court said that the man’s kin who were named in the FIR “have been living in different cities and have not resided in the matrimonial house of” the husband. “Hence, they cannot be dragged into criminal prosecution and the same would be an abuse of the process of the law in the absence of specific allegations made against each of them,” it added.","category":"india"},{"publishedAt":"2024-12-11","title":"Fear, uncertainty has gripped Manipur: Gaurav Gogoi","description":"The Congress leader said extortion has become rampant in Manipur, the economy has been shattered and basic public services were on the brink of collapse.","urlToImage":"https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/12/feature-image-78.jpg?w=640","content":"Congress leader Gaurav Gogoi on Wednesday said Manipur was in the throes of a grave humanitarian crisis and demanded that Home Minister Amit Shah make a statement in Parliament on the issue.

When their relatives started calling up, Akhila understood what had happened, and quickly repaid the entire Rs 2,000. But the agents kept circulating the morphed photo. Narendra could not take the humiliation and committed suicide,” Rao said. “We are taking the help of the Cyber Police to track down the loan app and the agents who harassed them.” Akhila, who works as a nurse’s assistant, was not home when he took his life. His mother and elder sister were in a separate part of the house, but did not know what had happened until Akhila returned in the evening. “In spite of paying off the loan with interest, the agents kept up the harassment. They got access to all his contacts and started spreading the morphed photo. He was a sensitive and caring person. He could not tolerate the humiliation. He loved his wife very much and had taken a stand to marry her against everyone’s wishes,” said his father Ankayya. Police have filed a case under Section 108 of the BNS (abetment of suicide) and relevant sections of the IT Act. This is the second incident involving loan apps in two days. Police in Nandyala said a young girl who took a Rs 15,000 loan through an app attempted suicide and was rescued just in the nick of time. Despite repaying five times the amount, she was threatened that her personal photos would be posted online, police said. Unable to cope, she went to Srisailam and jumped from a 20 feet high forest fence to end her life. Cops stationed at Srisailam police jumped in and rescued her, provided treatment, and safely handed her over to her parents. The Andhra Pradesh Police have issued an advisory, which urges the public to be cautious when using loan apps. “Verify their legitimacy and avoid sharing personal information. If you receive threats, report to the police immediately,” it states.","category":"india"},{"publishedAt":"2024-12-11","title":"Uproar in Parliament over George Soros, no-trust notice against Jagdeep Dhankhar","description":"While MP Gaurav Gogoi alleged in the Lok Sabha that the government was using George Soros as a ‘shield’ to hide its ‘failures’ in Manipur, J P Nadda in the Rajya Sabha questioned Sonia Gandhi’s links to the US-based investor.","urlToImage":"https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/12/dhankar_abed51.jpg?w=640","content":"Both Houses of Parliament witnessed uproarious scenes on Wednesday over the no-trust notice against Vice-President Jagdeep Dhankhar and the George Soros issue, leading to the Rajya Sabha being adjourned for the day and repeated adjournments in the Lok Sabha. The Lower House functioned smoothly during Question Hour and Zero Hour until Gaurav Gogoi, deputy leader of the Congress in the Lok Sabha, made a remark alleging that the government was using US-based investor Soros as a “shield” to hide its “failures” in Manipur. “I rise to discuss the grave and humanitarian situation in Manipur. The entire state is in a humanitarian crisis. Instead of finding a solution, the government is sending paramilitary forces and enforcing the Armed Forces Special Powers Act (AFSPA),” Gogoi said, raising the issue of violence in Manipur during Zero Hour. “This is not addressing the cycle of violence. Extortion has become rampant, the economy shattered, basic public services are on the brink of collapse. Unfortunately, there has been a rise in the illegal trade of arms, drugs, and timber,” Gogoi added. “The impact on the lives of the ordinary people has been devastating — schools and colleges closed, thousands of students’ education at risk, and healthcare facilities are damaged or destroyed. Fear and uncertainty have gripped the population,” Gogoi further said. “The time for inaction is over. People of Manipur are suffering. They have only three questions in mind. The first question is when will the Prime Minister visit Manipur? The second question is when will the Minister of Home Affairs apprise the House that what will be taken to resolve the situation? The third is that this government, in order to hide their failures in Manipur, is using George Soros as a shield. To hide their failures…,” Gogoi said, drawing a strong reaction from the treasury benches. Criticising the Congress MP over his remarks, Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal said the Manipur situation was being tackled at the highest level. “They [Congress] have to respond and let the nation know what connection is there between George Soros and all these internal disturbances. The Congress Party is responsible for the internal disturbances in the country and they are using the foreign forces…They have an extra set of tie-ups with foreign forces due to which the country is facing internal problems. The Congress Party is solely responsible for this situation. The Manipur situation is being tackled very adroitly at the highest level,” Goyal said. “I would like to ask this to the Congress Party. When did your Prime Minister ever visit any of the North-Eastern states which were having a problem? When did their Prime Minister ever take interest in the problems in Assam, from where he was an Hon. Member? It is because the Congress Party is using George Soros and other international bodies that the country today is suffering… There are internal problems caused by the Congress Party’s association with George Soros-funded organisations. The Congress Party is solely responsible and it has to answer the nation. What is the connection with the leaders of the Congress Party? What is the nexus? It is due to which the Congress Party and George Soros-funded organisations like them are destabilising the Indian economy…,” Goyal said. Nadda questions senior Congress leadership’s links with Soros Leader of the House in the Rajya Sabha, J P Nadda, levied similar allegations against the Congress soon after the Upper House reassembled at noon following the day’s first adjournment. Nadda said that the senior Congress leadership’s links with Soros should be discussed in the House because it is a matter related to India’s sovereignty and security. He also alleged that the INDIA bloc’s allegations against Rajya Sabha chairman Dhankhar were a design to deviate from the issue. “In the last two days we have been raising the issue of the connection between George Soros and the senior leadership of the Congress. What is the relation between Sonia Gandhi and George Soros? This is the matter of the nation’s internal and external security. This is also the matter of India’s sovereignty. This is the question on the sovereignty of the country and the major opposition party and the relationship between George Soros should be discussed,” Nadda said in the Rajya Sabha. The Union minister alleged that Congress was becoming a “tool of external forces”. “Bringing a no-confidence motion against the Chair is a design to deviate the attention of the nation from the issue of the sovereignty of the country…It should be condemned by one and all. They have never respected the Chair,” Nadda said. After Nadda’s remarks and amid sloganeering by the Opposition, the House was adjourned for the day to meet on December 12. Earlier, as the Upper House convened at 11 am, Union Parliamentary Affairs Minister Kiren Rijiju slammed Congress over the no-trust motion against Dhankhar and said that if the Opposition attacks the dignity of the Chairman, “we will protect”. Rijiju said the son of a farmer has become the vice-president and the entire country has seen he has kept the dignity of the House. He also slammed the Opposition saying: “You have no right to be members if you can’t respect the Chair. We have taken an oath to protect the sovereignty of the country,” he said. Later, in a post on X, Congress leader Jairam Ramesh recalled the words of Vice-President Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan and hoped the present Rajya Sabha chairman followed his words. “May 16th 1952. It was the very first day of the Rajya Sabha. The Vice President of India and the Chairman of the Rajya Sabha, Dr. Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan, told the MPs: ‘I belong to no party and that means I belong to every party in the House’. That is the essence of cool impartiality.” Opposition parties on Tuesday had given notice to move a motion to impeach Dhankhar over his alleged partisan role as the chairperson of the Upper House.","category":"india"},{"publishedAt":"2024-12-11","title":"Parliament ruckus: Rahul Gandhi meets Speaker Om Birla, seeks to expunge ‘derogatory’ remarks against him","description":"On allegations that the Congress’s top leadership has links with billionaire George Soros, Rahul Gandhi said the BJP wants to avoid a discussion on the Adani issue, but his party won’t allow it.","urlToImage":"https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/12/rahul-gandhi-1.jpg?w=640","content":"Amid the logjam in Parliament, Leader of Opposition in the Lok Sabha Rahul Gandhi met Speaker Om Birla Wednesday morning and told him that the Congress wants the House to function, besides asking him to consider the party’s demand of expunging the “derogatory” remarks against him.

The Speaker said he will examine them. See, they keep levelling all kinds of allegations. But we have decided. And it is my thinking that whatever provocation they do, we will let them.

On the allegations that the Congress’s top leadership has links with Hungarian-American billionaire philanthropist and investor George Soros, he said: “They don’t want discussion on Adani. They want to distract from Adani, but eventually we will not let it be. They can level allegations, but we want the House to run. It is not our responsibility to run the House, but we are saying that we will run the House.” While the Congress has been demanding a discussion on allegations against industrialist Gautam Adani, the BJP has hit back, accusing the Congress’s top leadership of collusion with Soros in a bid to destabilise the country. Demands by the two parties for discussions on the issues have meant that both houses of Parliament have not been functional during the ongoing Winter Session. The Opposition parties on Tuesday submitted a notice to move a no-confidence motion against Rajya Sabha chairman Jagdeep Dhankhar, while the BJP accused the Congress of using it as a diversionary tactic to distract people from the issue of its links with Soros.","category":"india"},{"publishedAt":"2024-12-11","title":"BJP sharpens attack on Congress, says Nehru-Gandhi family ties with Soros ‘run deep’","description":"In a post on X, the ruling party, citing media reports, said, \"Fori Nehru, a Hungarian like Soros, was married to BK Nehru, Jawaharlal Nehru's cousin, making her the aunt of Rahul Gandhi, former Congress President and Leader of the Opposition\".","urlToImage":"https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/12/nehru-gandhi.jpg?w=640","content":"The BJP on Wednesday intensified its attack on the Congress, alleging that the connection between US-based billionaire George Soros and the Nehru-Gandhi family runs deep, extending beyond Sonia Gandhi’s ‘role’ as co-president of the Forum of Democratic Leaders – Asia Pacific (FDL-AP). In a post on X, the ruling party, citing media reports, said, “Fori Nehru, a Hungarian like Soros, was married to BK Nehru, Jawaharlal Nehru’s cousin, making her the aunt of Rahul Gandhi, former Congress President and Leader of the Opposition”. George Soros is documented to have visited Fori Nehru and maintained extended correspondence with her and their association traces back to the time when BK Nehru served as India’s ambassador to the United States, the party claimed. “This raises questions about the extent to which the Nehru-Gandhi family may have compromised India’s strategic interests, over the decades, to benefit their extended family’s financial and entrepreneurial pursuits, as well as the interests of the deep state, they have been aligned with,” the BJP charged. “The connection between George Soros and the Nehru-Gandhi family runs deep, extending beyond Sonia Gandhi’s role as co-president of the Forum of Democratic Leaders – Asia Pacific (FDL-AP),” the BJP charged. The BJP has been on the offensive over the issue since last week when it alleged that Leader of Opposition Rahul Gandhi and former Congress president Sonia Gandhi had links with George Soros-backed outfits allegedly involved in anti-India activities. The Congress has dismissed the BJP’s allegations and said the real conspiracy unravelling during Parliament’s Winter session is that the government would even put at stake India’s ties with another country just to save businessman Gautam Adani. The BJP had on Sunday alleged that Sonia Gandhi has links to FDL-AP, financed by the George Soros Foundation and which has backed the idea of Kashmir as an independent nation.

A bench of Justices J K Maheshwari and Rajesh Bindal also questioned the ‘thantri’ (chief priest) for agreeing to change the ritual when he himself, in a news article published in 1996, had admitted that the rituals of the Guruvayur temple were streamlined by none other than Vedic philosopher Adi Shankaracharya himself and no deviation is permissible in that procedure. The court also issued notice to Guruvayur Devaswom administration in the matter. The bench, however, expressed regret that it cannot do anything this time as the hearing was happening on the Ekadashi day itself and the pooja had to start on Tuesday evening. The court said that the temple website itself mentions the importance of the pooja and directed the management to follow it scrupulously. Though senior advocate C S Vaidyanathan appearing along with advocate A Karthik had urged a bench presided over by Chief Justice Sanjiv Khanna on Tuesday morning to hear it urgently in view of the fact that ritual had to start by evening, the CJI had expressed inability to take it up the same day but assured that he would list it for hearing on Wednesday. The appellants who belong to the family which have priestly rights in the temple had approached the SC after the Kerala High Court dismissed their petition. On Wednesday, Vaidyanathan appearing with senior advocates Guru Krishna Kumar and K Parameshar told the bench presided over by Justice Maheshwari that the age-old tradition of the temple has been violated. He submitted that the temple administration has a duty to protect the tradition and that the chief priest alone could not have decided against conducting the pooja. Justice Maheshwari referred to the Kerala High Court order wherein it is recorded that “During the course of arguments, the learned counsel for the petitioners and the respective counsel for party respondents contended that Udayasthamana Pooja on the Ekadasi day of Vrishchikam is conducted to increase the divinity of the deity, which is a religious practice followed in the temple for time immemorial. It is the right of the deity that he should be worshipped on Vrishchikam Ekadasi by the performance of Udayasthamana Pooja by the Othikans.” Pointing out that this was the submission by both parties before the HC, Justice Maheshwari added that it is the right of the deity to be worshiped. Justice Maheshwari expressed surprise as to how the Guruvayur Devaswom, with the consent of the thantri, could then have changed the age-old tradition on the ground that huge crowd of devotees is expected. “How can a ritual be changed on that ground. You have to do what has to be done to the deity”, he said. The court took note of submissions that in case of doubts with any religious practice in the temple, it is decided after astrological condition known as ‘ashtamangalya prashnam’ and wondered any the same was not conducted before deciding against performing the ‘udayasthamana pooja’. The temple administration had taken the stand that “there is no deviation from any ritual… as alleged”, and said that the “litigation is the result of a family feud between the members of” family having priestly rights in the temple.","category":"india"},{"publishedAt":"2024-12-11","title":"6 Iranian nationals, found with 200 kg heroin in boat off Kochi, get jail terms in Kerala","description":"4 of them were sentenced to 12 years rigorous imprisonment and 2 were given 10 years","urlToImage":"https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/12/heroin.jpg?w=640","content":"A court in Kerala sentenced six Iranian nationals to rigorous imprisonment in a case pertaining to the seizure of 200 kilograms of heroin by the Navy from Indian territorial waters off Kochi in 2022.

He had also held the post of Secretary, Department of Financial Services. “Stability in policy is very important and this is something even in my previous role we were trying to give – stability or continuity in policy – whether it is taxation policy or fiscal policy or monetary policy. All businesses and people do need this continuity and stability rather than a day-to-day kind of a policy. We continue to hold this value, principle of stability,” he said. Malhotra steps into his role as the RBI Governor at a time when there are concerns over a slowdown in the domestic gross domestic product (GDP) and inflation has surpassed the central bank’s comfort zone. In the second quarter of the current fiscal, real GDP slowed to a seven-quarter low of 5.4 per cent while consumer price-based inflation (CPI), or retail inflation, surged to a 14-month high of 6.21 per cent in October 2024. For the new governor, the top-most priority would be maintaining the growth-inflation balance. Malhotra further said that public consultation is one key pillar of policy making which the RBI does whenever it publishes or finalizes its regulations or master directions. “This is one thing that I will continue to do so that we are able to carry forward all the functions and objectives with which the RBI has been entrusted with,” he stated. The Governor said that the RBI in its 90th year has adopted the theme of stability, growth and trust, and he will take it forward. “Ours is still an economy which needs to develop as we are entering Amrit Kaal and to realise the vision of Viksit Bharat 2047. The huge responsibility that we have in ensuring that the growth that this country actually has, continues,” he said. On financial inclusion, Malhotra said although a lot of progress has been made on this front, more needs to be done. “We need to collaborate with financial regulators, central government and state governments so that the benefits of formal financial inclusion reach everyone,” he said. The Governor said the RBI will focus on using technology to reduce costs and make financial inclusion more accessible to people. In his brief interaction, Malhotra refrained from discussing any policy-related matter. “It’s my first day and if I start playing my shots from day one, from ball one, I don’t think it will be appropriate on my part. I would first like to see and understand various issues, discuss with my officers, deputy governors, executive directors, get into the grips of all the different issues that the RBI is supposed to be looking at and then come back to you,” he said.","category":"business"},{"publishedAt":"2024-12-11","title":"Toyota Camry 2024 launched in India: From price tag to specifications, here’s all you need to know","description":"New Toyota Camry Price, Features, Specifications: The new Camry comes with a refreshed design and a fifth-generation hybrid engine.","urlToImage":"https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/12/Camry.jpg?w=640","content":"Toyota Kirloskar Motor launched its new Camry hybrid in India at an ex-showroom price of Rs 48 lakh on Wednesday. While it is the most expensive Camry to be launched in India to date — Rs 1.2 lakh more than the previous model — the company claims a fuel efficiency of 25.49 kmpl, up from 19.1 kmpl claimed by the previous generation Camry hybrid. The car will be available to customers for booking now and the deliveries will start soon as the cars are in transit to the dealerships, the company said. As the company launched its fifth-generation hybrid technology amid the rising demand for electric vehicles, Vikram Gulati, country head and senior VP, Toyota Kiskoskar Motor said: “Clearly the trend is towards sustainable mobility and cleaner technologies. Globally, last year hybrid sales grew by 33 per cent and EV sales grew by 31-32 per cent. So basically neck and neck. In the Indian context, there is a huge space out there that needs to be addressed. About 95 per cent of the market continues to be fossil fuel-based. Going forward, we feel that many technologies, either electric or biofuel, are going to be very relevant in our pursuit of green mobility and decarbonisation.” Powered by Toyota’s 5th Generation Hybrid Technology with a high-capacity lithium-ion battery, the car has an upgraded 2.5 litre dynamic-force engine delivering 221 Nm of torque at 3,200 rpm. It is paired with an electronically controlled continuously variable transmission (e-CVT), which offers multiple driving modes — Sport, Eco, and Normal — to suit all driving styles and conditions.

Forex traders said the Indian rupee touched a fresh all-time low of 86.87 in intraday trade as change of guard at the Reserve Bank of India raised odds of a rate cut by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) in its February meeting. A bounce back in the US dollar from earlier lows also weighed on the rupee. However, positive domestic markets, FII inflows and reports of RBI intervention supported the rupee earlier in the day. At the interbank foreign exchange, the rupee opened at an all-time low of 84.87 against the greenback. The USD/INR pair traded in a tight range and ended the session at 84.84 (provisional) against the dollar, higher by just 1 paisa from its previous close. On Tuesday, the rupee settled for the day on a flat note higher by just 1 paisa at 84.85 against the US dollar. The government on Monday appointed revenue secretary Sanjay Malhotra as the 26th Governor of the Reserve Bank of India. Malhotra takes guard at a time when the Indian economy is faced with the dual challenge of slowing growth rate and high inflation. While Shaktikanta Das kept benchmark interest rates unchanged for almost two years in a bid to control inflation, the incoming governor is said to be a team player who believes prices cannot be managed by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) alone and the task needs government help as well. “We expect the rupee to trade with a negative bias on strength in the US dollar and a rise in global crude oil prices. However, positive domestic equities and FII inflows may support the rupee at lower levels,” said Anuj Choudhary – Research Analyst at Mirae Asset Sharekhan. Choudhary noted that any further intervention by the RBI may also support the rupee. Investors may remain cautious ahead of US inflation data. Inflation is expected to be higher than the previous month. USD-INR spot price is expected to trade in a range of 84.65 to 85.10. The dollar index, which gauges the greenback’s strength against a basket of six currencies, was trading higher by 0.25 per cent at 106.66.

In his comments at the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII’s) Global Economic Policy Forum in New Delhi, Nageswaran also said regulators should “live by the same principles of transparency” that apply to regulated entities, including exhaustive disclosures around proposed regulations. “In our country, we have focused more on making sure that not a single act of deviant behavior goes unpunished, and that is something we need to reflect on. Where is the trade-off? Especially in the current context, where I think growth is going to be at a premium,” Nageswaran said. “Therefore, what is it that the regulator has to optimize rather than maximize in this case? That is the question that the regulators have to ask themselves,” he added. Nageswaran’s remarks come after the former Revenue Secretary Sanjay Malhotra, now the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) Governor, cautioned against the overreach of tax officers, asking them to prioritise economic interests over revenue targets. “We are here not only for revenue but also for the whole economy of the country. So, if in the process of garnering some small revenue, we are hurting the whole industry, or the economy of the county, it is certainly not the intent. Revenue comes in only when there is some income, therefore, we have to be very cautious so that we do not, as they say, kill the golden goose,” he said last week at an event organised by the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI). Highlighting the need for greater transparency, Nageswaran stressed that regulators must justify their actions with clear goals and timelines. “The same principle of transparency and social costs and benefits that we want to apply to regulated entities should also apply to the regulators themselves,” he said. Nageswaran outlined a framework for regulatory accountability, including information sharing on why a regulation is proposed, the data backing it, the objectives it seeks to achieve, and criteria for its eventual repeal. “There has to be accountability on the part of the regulator and they have to be conscious of the fact that they represent unelected power,” he said, adding that regulators must self-impose checks to wield power responsibly. Drawing a distinction between financial and non-financial sectors, Nageswaran argued that regulatory approaches must differ. In non-financial sectors, except for natural monopolies and utilities, he argued competition can often serve as an alternative to regulation. “You can expect competition to take care of much of the roles that regulators are expected to perform, so as long as you create a competitive environment as close to the theoretical perfect competition,” he said. In financial sectors, Nageswaran said regulators have a tendency to lean towards “excessive regulation” because the effects of a problem would be systemic and not sectoral. “And two, when things go wrong, it is the state that is expected to bail out the overall economy. If I am going to be asked to pitch in the resources required to set the problem right, then naturally I have to have a say in making sure how that system is run as well,” he said. Nageswaran also advocated for a balanced regulatory approach towards cryptocurrency and online gaming. “We are a low-income country and we have extensive amount of financial illiteracy, which is true in developed countries as well. So, in that situation, how do we distinguish between not standing in the way of moonshots and in which sectors do we have to be more conscious of social costs and benefits, whether it is crypto, bitcoins, online gaming, etc.,” he said.","category":"business"},{"publishedAt":"2024-12-11","title":"Industry pressing to raise tariffs, need to look at competitiveness: DPIIT Secy","description":"This comes as the Steel Ministry has urged the Commerce and Industry Ministry to raise tariffs on steel imports by 25 per cent.","urlToImage":"https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/12/startup.jpg?w=640","content":"There have been consistent efforts to integrate India with the global supply chain and reduce tariffs to the global average, but pressure to raise tariffs keeps emerging and so it needs to be looked at why India industry is not competitive enough, Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) Secretary Amardeep Singh Bhatia said on Wednesday. Bhatia’s comment comes at a time when large steel producers are pressing the government to significantly raise tariffs on steel. The Steel Ministry has asked the Commerce and Industry Ministry to raise tariffs on steel imports by as much as 25 per cent, citing a sharp surge in steel imports from countries with which India has signed free trade agreements (FTAs). However, Micro, Small & Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) have warned that such a step would harm the downstream industry, potentially driving them out of business due to an increase in steel prices. Notably, imported steel is much cheaper than domestic steel, raising concerns over competitiveness. “On the export market and integration with the supply chains, a lot of work has been done in terms of reducing tariffs. The weighted average tariff has come down substantially and is almost at the world average level. But, of course, there is pressure to increase it, and we need to look at why these requests keep coming up. Why are we not competitive enough?” Bhatia said while addressing the CII Global Economic Policy Summit. Indian steel companies are grappling with several challenges in international markets, leading to a sharp decline in exports and a significant rise in steel imports into India. During the first half of the ongoing financial year, steel imports into India surged by approximately 41 per cent, while exports declined by 36 per cent, official data showed. Moreover, there are risks of increased steel tariffs in the US, as US President-elect Donald Trump has signalled potential fresh tariffs on imported steel to safeguard the American steel industry. Trump said he would even block Nippon Steel, a Japanese company, from acquiring the Pennsylvania-based steel manufacturer, US Steel. Bhatia further said that around 45 per cent of Indian startups are emerging from tier two and tier three cities, adding that sector-specific interventions are being developed to deepen the startup movement. “We have established a robust startup ecosystem that is no longer confined to small pockets but is spreading across the country. In fact, 45 per cent of our startups are from tier two and tier three cities, which is very encouraging. Sector-specific interventions are being designed to further expand this movement,” Bhatia said. He added that free trade agreements (FTAs) are being negotiated, offering Indian businesses new opportunities following supply chain disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Bhatia said that substantial improvements in India’s industrial infrastructure, including the development of industrial parks, and pointed out the need to optimise land use to make industrial land more accessible. He also mentioned that the reduction in logistics costs and the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme have enhanced the competitiveness of Indian manufacturing. “Industry must provide the long-term vision and work together with the government to make India a manufacturing hub that not only serves domestic needs but becomes a key player in global markets,” he said. Separately, Sumita Dawra, Secretary, Ministry of Labour & Employment, said that by 2030, India’s working-age population will constitute about 65 per cent of the total population, positioning India as a key player in addressing global labour shortages. Dawra said that since 2017, over 7 crore Indians have joined the Employees’ Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO), and the government is undertaking initiatives to enhance employability and skill sets of the workforce. Urging the industry to leverage the Employment Linked Incentive (ELI) Scheme, she said that ELI is designed to incentivise the hiring of additional workers, particularly in the manufacturing sector, by offsetting the cost of employing new workers. The scheme aims to boost labour formalisation, enhance the employability of workers, and support job creation in key manufacturing industries. “India’s manufacturing competence is built on cost efficiency, a skilled workforce, and government support. With continued investment in key sectors, we will further enhance our global positioning. The industry should leverage new technologies, policies, and practices to make India a manufacturing powerhouse in the future,” Dawra said.","category":"business"},{"publishedAt":"2024-12-11","title":"One MobiKwik Systems IPO fully subscribed","description":"The public issue is entirely a fresh issuance of equity shares worth up to Rs 572 crore with no offer-for-sale (OFS) component.","urlToImage":"https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/12/mobikwik.jpg?w=640","content":"The initial public offering (IPO) of fintech company One MobiKwik Systems got fully subscribed within an hour of opening of the issue on Wednesday.

Sitharaman also urged the industry to work with the government to provide skill training to youth, adding that unless industry does this, it cannot say it does not get the “right kind” of manpower. Listing out decadal priorities at the Global Economic Policy Forum, organised by Ministry of Finance and Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), Sitharaman also said there is a need for industry to realign supply chains to factor in “not just economic sense but also political and strategic sense” so that they are spread so much that “no political or geopolitical or strategic risks will threaten our well-being”. “You should work together not just with the Indian government, but with governments across the world, if you are looking for trained and skilled manpower at various levels that you may need. Unless you are going to work with the governments to have them be trained in such skill sets which you require, it is going to be difficult for industry to say: I need manpower but I don’t get the right kind. You can’t sit and ask somebody to provide that for you. I would strongly call upon the industry to work together on a priority. To ensure use of technology, use digital instruments to make sure youth who get out of universities are trained in such a fashion that they are available for you when you want the manpower,” she said. The Finance Minister pointed out that India needs to have large enterprises for the scale and small enterprises for the horizontal scale, so that the spread ensures benefits such as job creation across the country. “Scale cannot be just the criteria. Large and larger corporations are welcome because they give you the advantages of scale. But I will also say scale together with spread…we need to have a blend of large (enterprises) for the scale and small (enterprises) for the horizontal scale. When I say horizontal scale, you cannot have one unit established in one place and producing with efficiencies of scale but they can only generate a certain number of jobs…unless enterprises spread across the length and breadth of any country, particularly for large countries like India, particularly for large countries with population of youth now in our favour, unless we spread across and give that energy for the micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs), you are just not going to reap the benefit for your demographic dividend, which is waiting to be fully realised.” “I would suggest for the decadal priority, industry should work together with small and medium units to see how they can be supportive of the large unit equally as much as they support job creation. So today the problem is not economic success, which is just production, but it is also economic success, which can spread benefits for those who are waiting for jobs and wages,” she said. Global supply chains, inflation Given the global geopolitical situation, Sitharaman pointed out that the economy will have to keep in mind not just commercial considerations or economics whether it is scale-based economics or otherwise, to blend the economy and its priorities with politics and strategic needs. “So when you talk of supply chains, when you talk or want to restore supply chains to some kind of ease, frictionless supply chains, let’s not forget that, it is just not economics, it’s more than that,” she said. Sitharaman said the economy has to “clawback” more to regain its strength after the Covid pandemic and any skirmish or war will impact the supply chains and food value chains. “The world is facing challenges which are reflected in the economy,” she said. Underlining the disruptions to global supply chains and food value chains, Sitharaman said the attempt of both the industry and the governments everywhere should be to “restore some global calm, normalcy, talk, sit and discuss”. “War should be avoided, disruptions should be avoided, they are the main cause for disruptions in supply chains, food value chains,” she said. In this context, she said inflation is a big challenge globally. “Inflation, as you know, doesn’t respect borders. Actually inflation is so contagious that nowhere is any country’s effort today completely successful because beyond its powers are inflation forces which come in. Therefore, the primary cause I would think is the disruption, the skirmish, the war. And, as a result, the world is facing a challenge which is reflected in many many ways in our economies,” she said. Debt management Sitharaman flagged the need for efficient debt management, saying that “responsible economies can’t be run with borrowings so large that the next generation and generation after that already knows what it is liable to repay” which would then require it to be passed through as taxation. She said it is important for both federal and provincial governments to manage their debt well. “I would think it is absolutely important for governments and for industry to work together to say how best debt can be managed at the national level and I hate using this word, but I would say, at the sub-national level. I mean the federal and the provincial level. It is important for us to manage our debt,” she said.","category":"business"},{"publishedAt":"2024-12-11","title":"RBI new Governor Sanjay Malhotra’s first agenda: Rate cut in February?","description":"The new Governor inherits a fairly stable financial, monetary ecosystem unlike his predecessors","urlToImage":"https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/12/Sanjay-Malhotra-Feat.jpg?w=640","content":"Sanjay Malhotra takes charge at the Mint Street headquarters of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) at a time when the country’s financial system and the economy in general are broadly charting a stable phase, with an interest rate cut looming in the horizon. This is unlike his predecessors who mostly faced turbulent times when they took over the Governor’s post. How former Governors kicked off terms D Subbarao who took over as the RBI Governor on September 5, 2008, faced baptism by fire as the country’s economy was hit by the global financial crisis triggered by the collapse of the Lehman Brothers. Subbarao cut the repo rate from 8.5–9 per cent to 3.5 per cent over a period of six months as Indian financial system was hit by the global crisis. He also cut the CRR and SLR — amounts that banks have to keep with the RBI — to historically low levels to tackle the crisis. On September 5, 2013, hours after taking over as the new governor of the Reserve Bank of India, Raghuram Rajan was forced to announce a bold blueprint for the financial sector at a time when the economy is faced with a multi-pronged crisis of high consumer price inflation, industrial slowdown, a free fall of the rupee and a widening current account deficit (CAD). These measures were aimed at stabilising the Indian economy after taper tantrum, or tapering of quantitative easing in the US, rocked the global markets again. Faced with the taper tantrum, Rajan announced plans to internationalise the rupee, float inflation bonds linked to the consumer price index, steps to boost exports and increase inflows, plans to review the monetary policy process and gave banks the freedom to open branches without having to approach the RBI for licences. Express Opinion | Sanjay Malhotra has his task cut out Soon after Urjit Patel became the Governor in 2016, the government announced demonetisation of Rs 1000 and Rs 500 notes and Patel, who didn’t oppose the plan, had a tough time in handling the banking system during the note withdrawal phase. Soon thereafter, he was involved in a major feud with the Finance Ministry on the issue of giving higher surplus dividend to the government which ultimately led to his exit. Shaktikanta Das, armed with the knowledge of his experience in the Finance Ministry, started on a quiet note in December 2018 but the Covid pandemic in early 2020 forced him to change the dynamics of central banking. During the pandemic, Das reduced the repo rate by 125 basis points to revive the economy and offered a loan moratorium to mitigate the adverse impact of the pandemic. The last mile disinflation challenge and questions over economic projections For Malhotra, there could be some challenges, but not as tough as those faced by his predecesors. While the GDP growth decelerated to 5.4 per cent in the second quarter ended September, the RBI has projected Q3 growth higher at 6.8 per cent and Q4 at 7.2 per cent. And if the CPI inflation for 2024-25 which is projected at 4.8 per cent manages to remain at that level, Malhotra will be all set to go for a cut in Repo rate in the February monetary policy review. Whether it will be 25 bps or 50 bps is the moot question. However, former Governor Das indicated last week that slowdown in domestic economic activity bottomed out in the second quarter (Q2) of 2024-25, and has since recovered, aided by strong festive demand and pick up in rural activities. It was seen that Governors coming from the government side are predisposed to lean in favour of what the government’s views are on the growth-inflation dynamics, but eventually they change their working ethos and integrate into the RBI culture. The internal bureaucracy in the RBI is very strong and they don’t generally subscribe to the wishes of the government, according to offcials. This was evident in the case of D Subbarao, YV Reddy and even Shaktikanta Das at a later stage. The government, which was expecting a rate cut in the December policy review, will also want the rate cut happen. Days before the end of the tenure of Das, two union ministers called for a cut in the repo rate ahead of the monetary policy review on December 8. Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman batted for “affordable bank interest rates” to support industries to ramp up and build capacities. Union Minister for Commerce and Industry Piyush Goyal also urged the RBI to cut interest rates to boost economic growth and look through food prices while deciding on monetary policy. However, much against the wishes of the government, the RBI, which is keen to bring inflation under control, kept the Repo rate unchanged at 6.50 per cent. This goes against the claim of Das on Tuesday that the co-ordination between the government and the RBI was “at its best” in the last six years. There was also a proposal to exclude food inflation from the CPI inflation from the government side in order to facilitate a reduction in interest rates. This stoutly opposed by Das and the RBI. In 2018-19, after Das, who was with the government earlier, became the Governor, the RBI made the highest surplus transfer was Rs 176,051 crore. This is after his predecessor Urjit Patel stoutly opposed a high surplus transfer to the government. In FY2024, the RBI, under Das, declared a bonanza to the Central Government, approving a massive, all-time high surplus transfer of Rs 210,874 crore. Clearly, the government wants the RBI to cut the rate to boost the GDP growth. “We believe that the next MPC policy in February 2025 may announce a repo rate cut of 25 bps. The RBI has been adopting a calibrated approach so far but as the slowdown in growth becomes more apparent, the RBI will need to provide monetary support,” said Puneet Pal, Head- Fixed Income, PGIM India Mutual Fund.","category":"business"},{"publishedAt":"2024-12-11","title":"Sensex, Nifty swing between high, lows in volatile trade ahead of US inflation data","description":"Market analysts said investors will monitor the November US CPI, the final inflation reading for further cues before the Federal Reserve's year-end policy meeting.","urlToImage":"https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/12/SENSEX.jpg?w=640","content":"Equity benchmark Sensex and Nifty edged up in volatile trade on Wednesday amid mixed global trends ahead of the US inflation data.

These stocks will be available for settlement from January 31, 2025. While the Sebi move is aimed at speeding up the settlement cycle, which currently stands at T 1, the same-day settlement cycle will continue to be optional. Currently, only 25 stocks are available for the T 0 settlement. The beta version of the settlement cycle was launched in March this year, but the response has been tepid, with negligible volumes. Brokers will be permitted to charge a differential brokerage for the facility. Qualified stock brokers, or those classified as large brokers given their client size and volume managed, have been directed to put in place processes and systems for smooth implementation. In December last year, the regulator had proposed to introduce a facility for clearing and settlement of funds and securities on T 0 on an optional basis. It had also proposed to introduce an optional instant settlement at a later stage. Under the T 0 trade cycle, the settlement of trades will happen on the same day after the closure of the market. If investors sell a share, they will get the money credited to their account the same day, and the buyer will also get the shares in their demat account on the very day of the transaction. The Sebi announced a block deal window from 8.45 am to 9 am for the T 0 cycle, in addition to the existing block deal windows for the T 1 settlement. A shortened settlement cycle will bring cost and time efficiency, transparency in charges to investors and strengthen risk management at clearing corporations and the overall securities market ecosystem. The T 0 trade cycle is expected to provide flexibility in terms of faster pay-out of the funds against the securities to the sellers and faster pay-out of securities against the funds to the buyers. It will allow better control over funds and securities by the investors. For the securities market ecosystem, a shorter settlement cycle will further free up capital in the securities market, thereby enhancing the overall market efficiency. It will enhance the overall risk management of clearing corporations (CCs) as the trades are backed by upfront funds and securities.","category":"business"},{"publishedAt":"2024-12-11","title":"South Africa, Namibia, Turkey back India in opposing China-led WTO pact: Official","description":"This comes at a time when investment flows are increasingly shifting away from China due to a possible US-China trade war and a weakening consumer demand in China.","urlToImage":"https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/12/wto.jpg?w=640","content":"The China-led Investment Facilitation for Development (IFD) agreement has gained the support of 128 countries at the World Trade Organization (WTO) but India, along with South Africa, Namibia, and Turkey, will continue to oppose the initiative due to its potential to undermine the policy space of weaker nations, a central government official said on Tuesday ahead of the WTO General Council meeting in Geneva on December 16-17. This comes at a time when investment flows are increasingly shifting away from China due to a possible US-China trade war and a weakening consumer demand in China. These investments are increasingly moving to ASEAN countries as Chinese firms have increased their overseas assets to record levels. “There is tremendous pressure and momentum from China. They have secured support from 128 out of 166 WTO members, including Pakistan. Four nations—India, South Africa, Namibia, and Turkey—are opposing it. The US is not opposing it but has opted to stay out of the agreement,” the official said. Notably, Pakistan was initially not part of the IFD. The official emphasised that India believes many nations supporting the IFD are under the wrong impression that it will benefit them. “For developing countries, this agreement will impact their policy space. While more members may join, India will continue to oppose it,” the official said. The IFD claims to improve the global investment climate and foster international cooperation to facilitate foreign direct investment (FDI) flows among WTO members, particularly benefiting developing and least-developed countries, a WTO note said. Proposed in 2017 by China and other nations reliant on Chinese investments, the agreement is supported by countries with substantial sovereign wealth funds. However, experts argue the pact could harm India’s interests and restrict its policy space on FDIs. ‘Per capita distribution of subsidies for fisheries’ Separately, the official noted that India has advocated for a “per capita distribution of subsidies” criterion to address concerns about overfishing and overcapacity within the WTO framework. India informed the WTO that its annual fisheries subsidy amounts to $35 per fisher, significantly lower than the $76,000 provided by some European nations. India has submitted a document, ‘Designing Disciplines for the Overcapacity and Overfishing Pillar: A Case for Intensity-Based Subsidies Approach’, which will be discussed at the WTO General Council meeting in Geneva. The WTO is negotiating an agreement to discipline subsidies that contribute to overfishing and overcapacity. In 2022, member countries finalised a pact to curb subsidies for illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing. “Adopting a per capita distribution of subsidies criterion could provide a more accurate and fair basis for managing overfishing and capacity issues, addressing both stock sustainability and livelihood concerns,” India stated. It added annual aggregate fisheries subsidies cannot be an accurate measure, as they include both beneficial and subsistence subsidies linked to livelihoods, which do not contribute to overcapacity or overfishing.","category":"business"},{"publishedAt":"2024-12-11","title":"Female labour force participation rate rose during 2017-18 to 2022-23","description":"Bihar, Punjab, Haryana record low female LFPR, N-E states show improvement.","urlToImage":"https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/12/women-labour-1.jpg?w=640","content":"Female labour force participation rate (LFPR) increased in almost all states in India during 2017-18 to 2022-23, with rural areas seeing larger gains than urban areas, a new working paper released by the Economic Advisory Council to the Prime Minister (EAC-PM) stated. States such as Bihar, Punjab, and Haryana have consistently reported very low levels of female LFPR, the paper stated, underlining that this inter-state variation in female LFPR is important in the context that Haryana and Punjab are among the richest states within India, while Bihar is the poorest state. Rural female LFPR rose to 41.5 per cent (~69 per cent growth) from 24.6 per cent during 2017-18 to 2022-23, while urban LFPR rose to 25.4 per cent from 20.4 per cent, the new working paper titled Female Labour Force Participation Rate: An Observational Analysis of the Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS) 2017–18 to 2022–23, and co-authored by EAC-PM Member Shamika Ravi and Mudit Mapoor of EPU, ISI–Delhi, said. It pointed out that even after excluding all those who worked as unpaid family workers or helpers in household enterprises from 2004-05 until 2022-23, the overall trends for increase in female LFPR remain the same as before. “In fact, we find that there has been a consistent rise in female LFPR post 2017-18 (even before the pandemic); and this rise is more pronounced in rural areas than in urban areas across India,” it said. Also Read | Indian workforce needs 145 million more women to hit $30 trillion economy target by 2047: Report One of the criticisms of the rise in female LFPR over the recent years has been that the majority of the increase has been seen for unpaid family work. In terms of marital status, the paper said that married men consistently exhibit higher LFPR across states and age groups, while marriage significantly reduces female LFPR, especially in urban areas. In terms of age, female LFPR forms a bell-shaped curve, peaking at 30-40 years of age and declining sharply after. The male LFPR, on the other hand, remains high (nearly 100 per cent) from ages 30-50, declining gradually thereafter, the paper said. Among the northern states, Punjab and Haryana have recorded low female LFPR. Among the eastern states, rural Bihar had the lowest LFPR in the country, the paper said, adding that it has shown improvements in recent years, especially for rural married women. Among the northeastern states, there has been improvement in female LFPR in rural areas with Nagaland and Arunachal Pradesh leading among the states of the region. The paper also made a mention of the various government schemes such as Mudra loans, the Drone Didi scheme and Deendayal Antyodaya Yojana, which have been focused on women-led development. While pointing out that their analysis shows an increase in female LFPR between 2017-18 and 2022-23 across many states, it said rigorous future research would be needed to assess the impact of the government schemes. “These initiatives reflect the government’s intention to further the women-led development model. Rigorous future research would be needed to assess the impact of these programmes. However, our descriptive analysis does document a dramatic increase in female labour force employment between 2017-18 and 2022-23 across many states of India and particularly within rural areas,” it said.","category":"business"},{"publishedAt":"2024-12-11","title":"E-commerce firms must ensure transparency, uphold consumer interest: Pralhad Joshi","description":"The future of e-commerce in India is bright, inclusive and transformative, minister Pralhad Joshi said emphasising the sheer size and potential of India market.","urlToImage":"https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/10/Pralhad-Joshi.jpg?w=640","content":"Minister for Consumer Affairs Pralhad Joshi on Tuesday asserted that e-commerce companies have a significant role to play in ensuring transparent, trustworthy, and safe shopping environment for all consumers. Speaking at Amazon smbhav Summit, Joshi outlined the government’s all-out efforts to ensure that consumer rights are protected through slew of measures such as Consumer Protection Act, establishment of central consumer protection authority, consumer helplines, and specific rules to protect consumers from unfair trade practices in e-commerce sector. The future of e-commerce in India is bright, inclusive and transformative, the minister said emphasising the sheer size and potential of India market. “While this digital revolution offers incredible opportunities, our government believes it is equally important for our consumers to feel confident and make informed choices, and for the e-commerce platforms to gain the trust and the confidence of the consumer is equally very, very, very important,” Joshi pointed out. The rapid growth of e-commerce also brings with it the risk, specially around consumer protection and rights of users, he cautioned. “Our government, under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, has taken multiple initiatives to create a trusted and the safe e-commerce environment,” he said. Rules are in place to protect the consumers from the unfair trade practices in the e-commerce sector. “Online platforms are now required to provide accurate product details, clear pricing and disclose the country of origin and with clear return and the refund policy at the same time ensuring the product quality,” he said. The minister also said that many-a-times platforms try and promote one particular brand, and when complaints are flagged by consumers, they claim they are just operating as a platform. The minister’s statements assume significance as e-commerce giants have been facing allegations of deep discount, preferential treatment of sellers, and predatory pricing in the India market. Joshi further said that the e-commerce momentum in India is being fuelled by strong economic growth, robust digital infrastructure, and low-cost data. “…our consumer base is good and because of economic policies…India’s economy is growing…we are the fastest-growing economy of the world, and we are the fifth-largest economy of the world. We are going to become third largest economy of the world very shortly. That means we will have that much of a customer base,” he said. The minister, however, emphasised the need for e-commerce companies to prioritise consumer interest. “…mega company like Amazon, you are already trying to create awareness on the consumer protection,” he said. Joshi recalled an incident when his wife ordered a ‘sari’ but was forced to lodge a compliant when the product delivered turned out to be a low-quality one. “…my wife’s experience…she ordered a sari, and when it actually came, it was a different one, very low quality one. But ultimately, to get the refund, my wife was forced to lodge a complaint,” he said, adding that companies should ensure that consumers do not face such issues. India, he observed, is taking remarkable strides in sustainability, driving significant initiatives to advance the renewable energy goals. “In 2014, we were just generating 75 gigawatt (GW) of renewable energy…Today, India has crossed 212 gigawatt of renewable energy. Installed capacity is more than 43 per cent and our goal is to achieve 500 gigawatt by 2030, that is 50 per cent of our energy needs will be met by renewable energy by 2030,” Joshi, who is also Minister for New and Renewable Energy, said.","category":"business"},{"publishedAt":"2024-12-11","title":"Restoring inflation-growth balance most important task ahead of RBI: Shaktikanta Das","description":"In his last press conference on Tuesday, Shaktikanta Das emphasized that during his six-year tenure as the RBI Governor, the co-ordination between the finance ministry and Reserve Bank has been “at its best”.","urlToImage":"https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/12/shaktikanta-das.jpg?w=640","content":"Outgoing Reserve Bank of India (RBI) Governor Shaktikanta Das on Tuesday highlighted certain challenges confronting the Indian economy and the central bank., including the task of restoring growth-inflation balance, cyber security risks and coping with the fast-changing geopolitical dynamics.

I am sure the team RBI under the leadership of the new governor… will take it forward,” Das told reporters. The country’s gross domestic product (GDP) slowed to a seven-quarter low of 5.4 per cent in the second quarter of FY25, while Consumer price-based inflation (CPI), or retail inflation, surged to a 14-month high of 6.21 per cent in October 2024.

The Governor said that cyber security threats and the associated risks pose a big challenge for every authority, not only in India but for all over the world, and particularly for a central bank. “In the last six years and even earlier, also, we have given a lot of attention to the issue of cyber security, and (are) dealing with cyber challenges and threats.

Talking about the central bank digital currency (CBDC), or e-rupee, Das stated that the RBI has been a pioneer in the domain of digital currency. Referring to CBDC as the “future of currency”, Das said it has a huge potential in the days to come. He said Unified Lending Interface (ULI) will be a game changer and hoped that it will soon be launched on a nationwide basis. The Governor said the RBI has given a lot of focus on financial inclusion but it is a continuing task.

Malhotra will take charge as 26th RBI Governor on Wednesday. The outgoing RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das will demit office this evening. The Appointments Committee of the Cabinet on Monday gave its nod for the selection of the 56-year-old Malhotra as the 26th RBI Governor with effect from December 11 for a period of three years. A B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering from IIT Kanpur in 1989, Malhotra later pursued his Master’s in Public Policy from Princeton University. He’s currently Revenue Secretary in the Ministry of Finance and before this was the Secretary, Department of Financial Services. As Malhotra steps into his role as the RBI Governor, the growth-inflation balancing act will rank among his top priorities amid concerns in some quarters of the Indian economy having slipped into a cyclical slowdown phase. A near two-year low 5.4 per cent GDP growth rate in July-September has already resulted in the RBI slashing its growth forecast by 60 basis points to 6.6 per cent for FY25. It has, however, maintained a neutral stance for monetary policy amid a continuing prolonged battle to bring down inflation within the range of the mandated medium-term target of 4 /- 2 per cent. Malhotra is taking charge at a time when indications of a slowdown in the economy are coming in from multiple quarters — a marked slide in credit growth, flagging consumption demand, especially in urban areas, and continuing softness in states’ and central governments’ capital expenditure.

However, the perceived delay in cutting the key policy rate has been a matter of difference between the RBI and the government as a high interest rate regime along with other macroprudential measures taken by the RBI such as higher risk weights on unsecured personal loans, a discussion paper on higher provisioning for project loans, and steps for digital lending seem to have had a collective impact in dampening growth.","category":"business"},{"publishedAt":"2024-12-11","title":"IT Ministry to prepare roadmap for power supply to AI data centres","description":"In India, the government is looking to subsidise setting up of data centres to capitalise on the AI boom, and make access to computing capacity easier for smaller entities like start-ups and research institutions.","urlToImage":"https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/12/There-is-a-massive-energy-requirement.jpg?w=640","content":"The IT ministry is in discussions with the ministries of power, and new and renewable energy, and other related agencies to prepare a roadmap to ensure that the growing numbers of data centres in India – a function of the global artificial intelligence (AI) boom – are offered enough power supply, a top government official said Monday. “Today, the biggest question is the availability of power… As we adopt AI more and more, (the question is) do we have enough power supply to power that – otherwise, where do you make sure that this power supply comes up in a way that we are able to address this issue,” said IT Secretary S Krishnan.

As per the International Energy Agency, data centre electricity usage could double by 2026, making the challenge for companies to become net zero or carbon negative by 2030 increasingly unattainable.

In India, the government is looking to subsidise setting up of data centres to capitalise on the AI boom, and make access to computing capacity easier for smaller entities like start-ups and research institutions. As per a September report by S&P Global, India currently has a leased data centre capacity of 1-3 GW, which is the highest compared to other emerging markets like Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam. A majority of the capacity is located in Mumbai (55 per cent), followed by approximately 12 per cent each in Chennai and Delhi-NCR. Savills, a real estate consultancy, expects additional supply of over 2,000 MW capacity between 2024 and 2028. Power consumption and related infrastructure costs are a key part of a data centres’ capital and operational expenditure. According to CareEdge Ratings, 40 per cent of capex of such facilities goes towards electrical systems and 65 per cent of operating cost is on account of electricity consumption. It takes between Rs 60-70 crore to set up one MW of data centre capacity in India. Naturally, the country is looking at the energy mix it can offer to data centres in India, where data centres are looking primarily at renewable energy to run operations. For instance, the Adani group will supply roughly 61 MW of electricity from its upcoming solar-wind hybrid project in Gujarat’s Khavda to Google’s cloud operations in India. As per a report released in September by Tata Power Company, the company is planning two pumped storage plants (PSPs) near Pune with a cumulative capacity of around 3,000 MW, for which the Central Transmission Utility of India (CTUIL) has received applications for drawal of 1,400 MW from data centre loads in Mumbai beginning January 2027. Also Read | Maharashtra cabinet gives approval for green integrated data centre park “The applications are under process and connectivity is being proposed at South Kalamb S/s to address the requirement of drawal of such huge quantum of power,” the transmission planning authority said in a September report. In October, the Central Electricity Authority (CEA) discussed the anticipated surge in power demand from data centres during a National Committee on Transmission (NCT) meeting, where CEA chairperson Ghanshyam Prasad directed the Power Data Management and Load Forecasting Division to study the load pattern of data centres. The direction followed an assessment of a major grid event in north India this June, which caused a load reduction of approximately 16.5 GW. An executive from Grid-India told the NCT that existing load modelling approaches need to be reviewed in light of changing load behaviour. “Further, as a large quantum of electrolyzer and data centre load is also envisaged to be connected at ISTS (Inter-State Transmission System) level in near future, it is important that adequate reactive power compensation is planned nearby such ISTS load feeding stations,” the executive said. Reactive power compensation near load centres helps prevent tripping and load shedding by stabilizing voltage levels and reducing strain on the grid. Data centre developers in India are aiming to increase energy efficiency, which is indicated by a low Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE) ratio. In India, the PUE averages around 1.9 while for green data centres, the PUE is lower at 1.3.","category":"business"},{"publishedAt":"2024-12-11","title":"Shaktikanta Das’ 6 years at Reserve Bank helm: Inflation remains unfinished agenda","description":"Handled multiple domestic as well as exogenous shocks.","urlToImage":"https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/12/Shaktikanta-Das-Governor-Reserve-Bank-of-India.-File.jpg?w=640","content":"For outgoing Governor of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), Shaktikanta Das, who led the central bank in the last six years with several key decisions and overhaul of the regulatory framework, inflation remains an unfinished agenda. Despite a 250 basis points hike in the repo rate — the key policy rate, between May 2022 and February 8, 2023, consumer price index-based (CPI) inflation continued to remain elevated and above the RBI’s comfort zone of 2-6 per cent, as mandated by the government. In the last policy review on December 6, the RBI kept the Repo rate, the main policy rate, unchanged at a high of 6.50 per cent amid the fall in GDP growth, squashing chances of a rate cut. The latest data showed that CPI, or retail inflation, surged to a 14-month high of 6.21 per cent in October 2024, compared to 5.5 per cent in September. Das, in his multiple speeches has admitted that the last mile of disinflation has been prolonged and arduous. “The disinflation process is getting a lot of resistance from food inflation remaining stubborn and very high, primarily because of supply-side factors which are affected by the weather conditions,” he had said at an event earlier this year. Read | ‘Calm influence’: Revenue Secretary Sanjay Malhotra next RBI Governor However, apart from inflation, Das’ track record has been uncontentious. The RBI, during his tenure, weathered various domestic as well as exogenous shocks including the collapse of Infrastructure Leasing & Financial Services (IL&FS) and its impact on other non-banking financial companies (NBFCs), once in a lifetime Covid-19 pandemic and the effect of Russia-Ukraine war on inflation. In his tenure as the RBI Governor for the last 6 years, Das used conventional and unconventional policy measures to maintain macroeconomic and financial stability in the country. Read | Govt vs RBI tussle: Echoes of the same script as Shaktikanta Das’ tenure ends During Covid 19 pandemic, Das reduced the repo rate by 115 basis points to revive the economy. He offered a loan moratorium to mitigate the adverse impact of the pandemic. The RBI, under Das, continued reforms in the banking sector at a time when lenders were reeling under the worst asset quality situation. The efforts resulted in an improvement in the gross non-performing assets (GNPAs) of banks from 10.8 per cent in September 2018 to 2.8 per cent at end-March 2024. He also jacked up risk weight on the exposure of banks towards consumer credit, credit card receivables and non-banking finance companies (NBFCs) by 25 per cent up to 150 per cent, to address the build-up of risks. The RBI also tightened norms for NBFCs that were aggressively pursuing growth without building up sustainable business practices and risk management frameworks. Das also refrained from granting banking licence to big corporate houses amid fears over connected lending and self-dealing if they are allowed in the banking space. “Experience world over has shown that when real sector companies enter into the banking space, there are potential conflicts of interest. The problem around related-party transactions is also a major issue,” Das had said in July this year. Under Das’ stewardship, the RBI surplus transfer reached an all-time high of Rs 2.11 lakh crore for the year 2023-24. Between FY19 and FY24, the RBI paid a total dividend of Rs 6.61 lakh crore to the government. He oversaw the withdrawal of Rs 2,000 notes without causing any disruption to common people and businesses. Das also focused on making Unified Payments Interface (UPI) and RuPay, the card payments network of the country, global. Das was instrumental in launching the central bank digital currency (CBDC), or digital rupee, for both wholesale and retail uses.","category":"business"},{"publishedAt":"2024-12-11","title":"Govt vs RBI Governor tussle: Repeat of the same script at the fag end of Shaktikanta Das’ tenure","description":"Turf wars between the two sides have played out for years as successive Governors sought to protect the autonomy and independence of the central bank.","urlToImage":"https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/12/Das-2.jpg?w=640","content":"Shaktikanta Das’ tenure at the helm of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) comes to an end on December 10 amid some degree of friction with North Block towards the end of his second term as Governor. The trigger was the central bank’s refusal to cut key policy rates despite growing calls on the need to tackle the slowdown in GDP growth. This tussle between the government and the Reserve Bank of India, though, is not something new or unusual. Turf wars between the two sides have played out for years as successive Governors sought to protect the autonomy and independence of the central bank. The four predecessors of Governor Das — YV Reddy, D Subbarao, Raghuram Rajan and Urjit Patel — had escalating conflicts with the governments in Delhi on issues, including the issue of cutting rates to spur growth. There was a repeat of this trend, with two union ministers recently calling for a cut in the repo rate ahead of the monetary policy review on December 8. Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman batted for “affordable bank interest rates” to support industries to ramp up and build capacities. Union Minister for Commerce and Industry, Piyush Goyal, also urged the RBI to cut interest rates to boost economic growth and look through food prices while deciding on monetary policy. However, much against the wishes of the government, the RBI, which is keen to bring inflation under control, kept the Repo rate unchanged at 6.50 per cent. Also Read | Das’ 6 years at Reserve Bank helm: Inflation remains unfinished agenda YV Reddy, who was RBI Governor from 2003 to 2008, had run-ins with then Finance Minister P Chidambaram and had to even offer an “unconditional apology” to the minister after the then Prime Minister Manmohan Singh tried to sort things out between them. Reddy, who contemplated quitting twice during his tenure, said the government has powers to give directions. But, in giving directions also, unlike other statutes, consultation with the Governor is necessary in regard to the RBI before issuing the directions, according to Reddy. A major area of disagreement between Reddy and Chidambaram related to the development of financial markets. Chidambaram was keen about the development of bond currency derivatives in an integrated manner. However, Reddy explained that there were other priorities for the financial sector reform. Reddy opposed the proposal made in February 2008 to write off loans to farmers amounting to Rs 60,000 crore. A proposal to utilise India’s growing foreign exchange reserves (during 2004-05 to 07-08) was mooted by the Planning Commission first and then by the government. That put the government in conflict with the RBI which was opposed to the proposal saying that it was not unencumbered. It was sorted out only after the RBI insisted that the government provide a guarantee on lending by a government backed entity – IIFCL from part of the reserves. After Reddy made a mention of Tobin tax on capital flows in a speech citing it as an empirical case, the government forced the Governor to clarify the same day that there was no intention to tax inflows. With differences between him and the Finance Ministry surfacing on several occasions, D Subbarao wrote that he was “invariably discomfited and annoyed by this demand that the RBI should be a cheerleader for the government”. Subbarao was the RBI Governor during 2008-2013 when the global financial crisis rocked the financial system. “Both Chidambaram and Pranab Mukherjee who were finance ministers during that period were vexed by the RBI’s anti-inflation stance, which they thought was stymieing growth,” Subbarao wrote in his recent book ‘Just A Mercenary? Notes from My Life and Career’ “I had run-ins with both Chidambaram and Mukherjee on the RBI’s policy stance. Both of them invariably pressed for softer rates although their styles were different,” Subbarao said, noting that Chidambaram typically argued his case like the lawyer that he so eminently is, while Mukherjee was the quintessential politician. Also Read | ‘Calm influence’: Revenue Secretary Sanjay Malhotra next RBI Governor The formation of the Financial Stability and Development Council or FSDC headed by the finance minister was a flash point between the finance ministry and the RBI. The central bank’s rationale was that the primary responsibility of stability was with the RBI and the new arrangement could undermine its influence. The Government still went ahead with the proposal when Pranab Mukherjee was the finance minister. The other major tussle which was played out in the open was on interest rates. Chidambaram as finance minister was pitching for lower interest rates at a time when inflation was still relatively high. When the RBI didn’t oblige, he went on to say that -if the government has to walk alone to face the challenge of growth, we will walk alone. That prompted Subbarao to respond a week before he completed his term that “I do hope that finance minister, Chidamabaram will one day say that I am so frustrated by the Reserve Bank that I want to go for a walk even if I have to walk alone. But thank God the Reserve Bank exists “. Raghuram Rajan who was the RBI Governor between 2013 and 2016, recalled the words of his predecessor Subbarao about “frustrated by the Reserve Bank, so frustrated that I want to go for a walk, even if I have to walk alone. But thank God, the Reserve Bank exists.” “I would go a little further. The Reserve Bank cannot just exist, its ability to say “No!” has to be protected,” Rajan said. In 2015 when the government incorporated a provision in the finance bill without consulting the RBI -to assign the responsibility of regulating the money markets to Sebi, the RBI protested fiercely. Rajan took his objections to the finance minister and the government, leading to the proposal being rolled back. Rajan was apparently not very enthusiastic about demonetisation of the notes. During his tenure, the RBI sent a note outlining potential costs and benefits of demonetisation, as well as alternatives that could achieve similar aims. “If the government, on weighing the pros and cons, still decided to go ahead with demonetisation, the note outlined the preparation that would be needed, and the time that preparation would take. The RBI flagged what would happen if preparation was inadequate,” he wrote. Rajan was not given an extension by the government. Weeks after he left the Governor post, the government announced demonetisation of Rs 1000 and Rs 500 notes. Urjit Patel took charge as the 24th Governor on September 5, 2016, and was chosen by the BJP-led government. Under him, relations between the RBI and the government remained fractious. Citing “personal reasons”, Patel quit as the RBI Governor on December 10, 2018. Under Patel, there were significant differences between the RBI and the government after the central bank resisted the government’s pressure to change policies on surplus transfer, liquidity window for finance companies and more powers for the RBI Central Board. The government had for the first time invoked a provision in the RBI law — Section 7 — to open a formal discussion with the Governor. During the tenure of Urjit Patel, the feud erupted when the government reportedly sought to tap into the RBI’s excess capital reserves. Then, it also wanted the central bank to relax lending norms to smaller businesses. Patel refused to buckle under pressure from the government on various issues and preferred to resign. According to Patel, as the government’s headroom for running higher fiscal deficits is exhausted, government banks are encouraged to (over) lend to pump-prime the economy and boost preferred sectors, he said in his book “Overdraft: Saving the Indian Saver”. Almost inevitably, this leads to higher NPAs over time, which requires equity infusion from the government, and this eventually adds to the fiscal deficit and sovereign liabilities, he blamed the government. On October 26, 2018, the slugfest between the RBI and the government came out in the open when then Deputy Governor Viral Acharya, in a stinging criticism, reminded the government about the need for an independent central bank and warned that “governments that do not respect central bank independence will sooner or later incur the wrath of financial markets, ignite economic fire, and come to rue the day they undermined an important regulatory institution”.","category":"business"},{"publishedAt":"2024-12-11","title":"Air India tops up its mega 470-aircraft order with another 100 Airbus jets","description":"New aircraft orders are critical to Air India’s fleet expansion and modernisation plan, which the airline embarked upon after the Tata group acquired it from the government in January 2022.","urlToImage":"https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/12/health-and-wellness-3.jpg?w=640","content":"In what may be seen as the Tata group’s growing confidence and ambition in India’s high-potential aviation sector, Air India has topped up its $70-billion order for 470 aircraft placed last year with another 100 Airbus jets, taking the cumulative order size to 570 planes. New aircraft orders are critical to Air India’s fleet expansion and modernisation plan, which the airline embarked upon after the Tata group acquired it from the government in January 2022. Air India’s 470-plane order with both major aircraft manufacturers Airbus and Boeing also included options to acquire up to 370 additional aircraft. In large aircraft orders, purchase options allow carriers to buy additional planes in future at a previously agreed-upon price and schedule. The airline did not divulge financial details of the latest 100-aircraft order. The 100 new Airbus aircraft ordered by Air India include 10 wide-body A350 planes and 90 narrow-body A320 family jets, including the A321neo. The 470-aircraft order, the world’s largest aircraft order at the time of its announcement in February 2023, was made up of 250 Airbus planes and 220 Boeing planes. With the latest top-up, Airbus now makes up for 350 of the 570 planes that will be deployed by Air India and its no-frills arm Air India Express. “With India’s passenger growth outpacing the rest of the world, its significantly improving infrastructure and an aspirational young population increasingly going global, we see a clear case for Air India to expand its future fleet beyond the firm orders of the 470 aircraft placed last year. These additional 100 Airbus aircraft will help to position Air India on the path to greater growth and contribute to our mission of building Air India into a world-class airline that connects India to every corner of the world,” said Tata Sons Chairman Natarajan Chandrasekaran, who is also the chairman of Air India. Under government control, Air India faced significant financial stress, which did not allow the airline to meaningfully expand or even modernise its fleet. The Tata group wants to transform the airline into a carrier of global repute by significantly expanding its fleet and network and sprucing up the product offering. These large aircraft orders are set to play a pivotal role in that journey. Air India has so far received six aircraft—all A350s—from its Airbus order, and the airline’s order book now at 344 planes. Of the 250 Airbus aircraft ordered by Air India last year, 40 were A350s, while the remaining 210 were A320 family jets. Of the 220 Boeing aircraft ordered by Air India, 35 737 MAX jets have already been delivered. Air India on Monday also announced it has selected Airbus’ Flight Hour Services-Component (FHS-C) to support the maintenance requirements of its growing A350 fleet. The new materials and maintenance contract will help Air India to optimise the reliability and performance of its A350 fleet, with comprehensive engineering services and integrated component services including on-site stock at Delhi provided by Airbus. Over the past couple of years, Indian airlines—Air India, IndiGo, and Akasa Air—grabbed global attention by placing orders for hundreds of new aircraft. A few months after Air India announced its 470-aircraft order, India’s largest airline IndiGo wrested the title of placing the world’s largest commercial aircraft order from Air India by ordering 500 Airbus A320 family planes. Then in April this year, IndiGo placed an order for 30 A350 aircraft. In January this year, Akasa Air placed a firm order for 150 Boeing 737 MAX family planes, taking its total order size for the aircraft to 226. In all, Indian airlines are now estimated to have nearly 1,300 aircraft on order. These are likely to be delivered till the mid-2030s. India is the world’s third-largest aviation market and is also among the fastest-growing major aviation markets globally. As compared to large mature aviation markets, the penetration of air travel in India is still insignificant, reflecting massive growth potential in the years to come.","category":"business"},{"publishedAt":"2024-12-11","title":"Kerala doctor suicide: Police arrest friend who backed out of marriage","description":"Shahana (26), a postgraduate student in the surgery department of the Government Medical College here, was found unconscious at her apartment and later declared brought dead at the hospital on Tuesday.","urlToImage":"https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/10/handcuff-4-2.jpg?w=640","content":"Two days after a female medical student’s suicide shocked the consciousness of the state, police on Thursday took into custody a doctor who had allegedly backed out of their marriage proposal recently as her family couldn’t meet the demand for hefty dowry. Shahana (26), a postgraduate student in the surgery department of the Government Medical College here, was found unconscious at her apartment and later declared brought dead at the hospital on Tuesday. Shahana allegedly took the extreme step as she was depressed due to a big dowry sought by the groom’s family, her family alleged. Based on their statements, Ruwais, her friend who is also a post graduate doctor in the College, was taken into custody from Karunagappally early today, police said. “We have taken him into custody based on the statements of the victim’s family. He is being interrogated,” a senior officer told PTI. He said a case of unnatural death was registered soon after the woman doctor’s death. Sections of abetment to suicide and Dowry Prohibition Act were added based on the statements of Dr Shahana’s family, he added. “We have to check the veracity of various statements we have recorded. Further proceedings including his arrest will be decided only after that,” the officer said. On Wednesday, the government had ordered a probe into the death of Shahana after allegations of dowry related issues causing the suicide cropped up. Health Minister Veena George directed the director of the Women and Child Development Department to carry out a probe and submit a report regarding this. The state Minority Commission also intervened into the issue and initiated a case on its own based on media reports in this regard. Its Chairperson A A Rasheed directed the district collector, city police commissioner and director of medical education to appear before the Commission during its next sitting here on December 14 and submit a report on the incident. State Women’s Commission Chairperson P Sathidevi visited Shahana’s residence in nearby Venjaramoodu and consoled her mother on Wednesday. The victim’s father, who was working in the Middle East, died recently. Expressing grief and concern over the alleged suicide of the young doctor, Sathidevi said stringent measures should be taken if the mental agony caused due to dowry had forced her to take the extreme step. People close to the deceased’s family had alleged that Shahana was depressed as her friend had backed out of their marriage citing dowry as the reason.","category":"kerala"},{"publishedAt":"2024-12-11","title":"Kerala Muslim leader says CPM leaders promoting interfaith marriages involving Muslim girls","description":"Nasar Faizy Koodathai, secretary of the Sunni Yuvajana Sangham, warns the community about the ruling party’s 'tactics with the label of secularism’.","urlToImage":"https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/12/Nasar-Faizy-Koodathai.jpg?w=640","content":"A prominent Muslim leader in Kerala has accused the ruling CPM of promoting interfaith marriages in such a way that Muslim girls are “being abducted and married off to non-Muslims” with the backing of the party and its youth and student wings. While addressing a meeting in Kozhikode, Nasar Faizy Koodathai, secretary of the Sunni Yuvajana Sangham, the youth wing of the influential Samastha Kerala Jem-iyyathul Ulama, said the community should remain vigilant about the CPM’s “tactics with the label of secularism”. Koodathai said that for certain people, secularism means a Hindu marrying a Muslim. “Recently we have seen unscrupulous political strategies to promote interfaith marriages. The Constitution permits that a Muslims should marry a Muslim and Hindu should marry Hindu. But certain people have a crooked view that Bhartiya culture can be promoted only when a Hindu marries a Muslim. Muslim girls are being abducted with the backing of the party’s offices, newspaper offices, leaders of the CPM, DYFI and the SFI, and they are being married off to non-Muslims. Mahallu (masjid) committees should stand united against such rejection of religion,’’ he said. This is the first time a leader associated with the influential body of Sunni Muslim clerics has publicly spoken against interfaith marriage in a state where Hindu and Christian outfits have accused Muslims of engaging in “love jihad’’. The Samastha Kerala Jem-iyyathul Ulama, or Samastha, is close to the Indian Union Muslim League, an ally of the Congress in Kerala. However, the CPM has recently been wooing Muslims through the organisation and its leaders have shared stages with the clerics on many issues. The government was accused of withdrawing plans to introduce gender-neutral uniforms in schools following protests, mainly from Samastha, which was of the view that such uniforms would encourage homosexuality.","category":"kerala"},{"publishedAt":"2024-12-11","title":"Renowned economist and Dalit thinker M Kunjaman found dead at home","description":"A native of Vadanamkurissi in Palakkad, Kunjaman was born to the Dalit community of Panan.","urlToImage":"https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/12/kunjaman.jpg?w=640","content":"Renowned economist, academician and prominent Dalit thinker M Kunjaman, 74, was found dead at his residence here on Sunday evening. He served as an Economics faculty at the University of Kerala, member of the University Grants Commission and professor at the Tuljapur campus of Tata Institute of Social Science (TISS). Kunjaman’s life is a remarkable journey of a Dalit amid caste oppression and poverty in the initial period of post-independent India to a well-known academician. Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan, in his condolence, said, “Kunjaman has been an economist who had his own perspective towards the development of Kerala. His autobiography, Ethiru, was a true reflection of the realities of life. His death is a big loss to Kerala.” A native of Vadanamkurissi in Palakkad, Kunjaman was born to the Dalit community of Panan. His parents were farm workers. He lived in abject poverty. Oppression remained a shadow throughout his journey. Recalling his childhood days, Kunjaman had once narrated how he had to grapple with dogs for daily meals. He grew up eating the leftovers of the rich landlords. Kunjaman struggled all his way to higher education while elementary education was rare for peers in his community. In 1974, he won the first rank in MA in Economics. He then became the second Dalit after late president K R Narayanan to bag first rank in post-graduation. But poverty continued to haunt the Dalit rank holder. He was forced to sell the gold medal, day after it was conferred to him, to buy provisions for his home. After MA in Economics, he joined MPhil at the Centre for Development Studies (CDS) in Thiruvananthapuram and later went on to obtain doctorate in Economics from Cochin University of Science and Technology. Even then, Kunjaman was initially denied the job of a teacher despite emerging as the top scorer in the merit list under the general quota. He was denied a job for being a Dalit. But well-wishers identified the brilliant academician in the Dalit youth, who began his career with the University of Kerala in 1979. He served as a faculty at the Economics Department for 27 years. For a brief period, he had been a member of the UGC. In 2006, he quit the University of Kerala and joined as a Professor of Economics at TISS. In 2021, his autobiography ‘Ethiru’ had been selected as the best autobiography by the Kerala Sahitya Academy. But Kunjaman refused to accept the honour. In his autobiography, Kunjaman had depicted the Dalit life in Kerala. He had authored several studies on land reforms, reservation and the Dalit crisis. His major works include ‘Development of Tribal Economy, State Level Planning In India, Globalization: A Subaltern Perspective, Economic Development and Social changing’. Kunjaman had been considered for several posts in the academic and planning arenas of Kerala but caste had apparently remained a major barrier.","category":"kerala"},{"publishedAt":"2024-12-11","title":"Kidnapping that gripped Kerala ends in arrest of couple and their YouTuber daughter","description":"The girl was abducted on Monday from Oyoor town and was found abandoned, but safe, at a ground in Kollam city the next day.","urlToImage":"https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/12/Kerala-police.jpg?w=640","content":"The abduction of a six-year-old girl in Kerala’s Kollam district – a case that has gripped the state this week – culminated with the arrest of a popular YouTuber and her parents on Saturday. The girl was abducted on Monday from Oyoor town and was found abandoned, but safe, at a ground in Kollam city the next day. Since then, police have been on the hunt for the kidnappers. On Friday, police traced the three accused – businessman K R Padmakumar (52), his wife Anitha Kumar (45), and their daughter, YouTuber and social media influencer P Anupama (20) – to Tenkasi in Tamil Nadu. The three were residents of Chathannoor in Kollam. Their arrest was registered on Saturday. It was a ransom call made by Anitha, demanding Rs 10 lakh from the girl’s family, that eventually led police to the accused, after a local resident recognised her voice. Additional Director General of Police (Law and Order) M R Ajith Kumar said the family was desperate for money because of the debt racked up by Premkumar. Padmakumar, an engineering graduate, ran a local cable TV service and also did farming, but faced a severe financial crisis during the pandemic, the ADGP said. He had purportedly borrowed money to the tune of around Rs 5 crore, and needed Rs 10 lakh immediately to tide things over with his creditors. “The abduction was originally planned a year back… They then revived the plan one-and-a-half months ago. They were looking for targets in a remote area, away from public attention,” the ADGP said. According to him, the accused had zeroed in on the six-year-old girl days before her abduction. Padmakumar’s daughter, Anupama, is popular on YouTube and other social media, and had been earning between Rs 3 lakh and Rs 5 lakh a month until recently before her content was demonetised, ADGP Kumar said. The reason for the demonetisation was not made clear. When her payments stopped coming through, “the daughter, who initially objected to the crime, also stood with her parents’ plan,” Kumar said. On the precautions taken by the accused ahead of the abduction, the ADGP said: “The car that the family used to abduct the girl had a fake number plate, which they had prepared last year. A second fake number plate was made recently.” According to police, they would take the car out regularly to look for a child to abduct. They would change number plates mid-journey, and were careful not to use mobile phones to communicate about this matter, police said. Last week, they spotted the six-year-old and her older brother walking down the road on their way to tuition classes, and identified her as a target. According to police, they would then repeatedly survey the area, and twice tried to abduct her before pulling out at the last moment because others were around. Finally on Monday, they found the siblings alone and managed to drag the six-year-old into their car before driving away, police said. They initially covered her mouth, and then got her to calm down by saying they were taking her to her father. The next step for the abductors was to seek ransom from the girl’s family, the ADGP said. Leaving the girl at home in Chathannoor with their daughter, the couple went to Kollam’s Parippally, after which Anitha took an auto to go to a shop. After making some purchases from there, she made a call to the girl’s mother from the shop owner’s phone and demanded Rs 10 lakh ransom. She had earlier taken the mother’s number from the girl, police said. Later, when TV channels got hold of the recorded call and started telecasting it, a local resident suspected that it was a voice that he knew. After he shared his suspicion with police, it led investigators to turn their attention to Anitha. Subsequent analysis of call details helped police find more evidence to suspect Anitha. On Monday, after the couple got back to their house, they realised that the abduction had become sensational news. They also realised that police were actively searching for the girl. This put them in a panic and they decided to abandon the plan. At around 11 am on Tuesday, they took the girl to Kollam city. After parking the car, Anitha Kumari took the girl in an auto to a ground in the city where she managed to drop her off without being noticed. Police, who had launched a massive search for the girl, soon located her at the ground and reunited her with her parents. Meanwhile, the three accused decided to leave Kollam, and headed to Tenkasi in Tamil Nadu where a family friend had a farm. However, police had already identified Anitha as the woman behind the ransom call, and found she had left the state with her husband and daughter. After tracking them for a couple of days, they were located and taken into custody in Tenkasi. The three accused were charged with abduction, wrongful confinement and conspiracy. They were produced before a magistrate court, which remanded them in judicial custody for two weeks.","category":"kerala"},{"publishedAt":"2024-12-11","title":"Kerala Guv Khan blames CM Vijayan for pressuring him to reappoint Kannur VC","description":"Khan, speaking to reporters here, said that state Higher Education Minister R Bindu was not to be blamed as the CM used her for seeking reappointment of Ravindran.","urlToImage":"https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/11/Arif-Khan-Pinarayi-Vijayan-1.jpg?w=640","content":"Kerala Governor Arif Mohammed Khan on Thursday accused Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan of pressuring him to reappoint Gopinath Ravindran as the vice chancellor (VC) of Kannur University.

The Kerala government had earlier this month moved the Supreme Court against the Governor regarding the delay in clearing Bills passed by the Assembly. Last week, the Supreme Court had asked the office of the Governor to go through its verdict in a similar case filed by the Punjab government, in which the top court held that Governors could not “thwart the normal course of lawmaking”. On Tuesday, the Governor cleared the Kerala Public Health Bill. The Bills sent for presidential assent are two University Amendment 2021 Bills, the Kerala Lokayukta Bill, two University Laws (Amendment) Bills, a Bill regarding the expansion of the University Search Committee, and the Kerala Cooperative Societies (Amendment) Bill. A three-judge Bench, led by Chief Justice of India D Y Chandrachud has been hearing the Kerala government’s plea against Governor Khan regarding the pending Bills. Pointing to the top court’s November 10 order in the Punjab matter, the CJI said the court would wait until November 28 to take up the matter again. “You ask the Governor’s secretary to look at it (the November 10 order) and tell us what your response is,” he told Attorney General R Venkataramani, who was representing the Governor. In its petition, the state had said the pending Bills involve ones that are of great public interest, and that the delay in their approval would lead to people being deprived of welfare measures. The Governor’s conduct, the state had said, “threatens to defeat and subvert the very fundamentals and basic foundations of our Constitution, including the rule of law and democratic good governance, apart from defeating the rights of the people of the state to the welfare measures sought to be implemented through the Bills.”","category":"kerala"},{"publishedAt":"2024-12-11","title":"Lives cut short in CUSAT stampede: Three bright students and a young job-seeker with big plans","description":"Other than the four deaths, 64 people were injured in the incident. Of the injured, 34 are still in hospital, with two of them on life support.","urlToImage":"https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/11/CUSAT-stampede.jpg?w=640","content":"Three students excelling in academics and passionate about art, and a young electrician with plans to move abroad – the four men and women in their 20s who died in a stampede during a festival at the Cochin University of Science and Technology (CUSAT) on Saturday evening had a bright future ahead of them, according to those who knew them well. The stampede took place after it started to rain minutes before a musical event was set to take place at the institute as part of its annual ‘Dhishna’ tech festival. When the rain began, the crowd waiting outside the lone entry gate reportedly rushed inside the covered amphitheatre, causing people to fall down on steep steps and get trampled. Other than the four deaths, 64 people were injured in the incident. Of the injured, 34 are still in hospital, with two of them on life support. Tearful farewell On Sunday, CUSAT bid a tearful farewell to the three students, whose bodies were laid at the campus for public homage. People’s representatives, CUSAT faculty members and hundreds of students lined past the bodies of the students. Later, the families took the bodies home. Engineering student Ann Riftha, 21, a native of Chendamangalam in Ernakulam district, was among those who died on Saturday. She was an upcoming performer of Chavittu Nadakam, a traditional musical dance drama art form popular among the Latin Catholic community in the coastal region of Kerala. She belonged to a family of Chavittu Nadakam artistes, with her father, Roy Georgekutty, a trainer in the art form. “The family was passionate about Chavittu Nadakam. Ann had started performing from childhood, and in her first performance, she played an angel,” family friend Shaiby Thomas said. Ann’s father also worked as a mason, and her mother, Sindhu, has been working as a home nurse in Italy for the last one year. Rithul, Ann’s brother, was studying hotel management. “The mother went to Italy to make money for her daughter’s education. She came to know about the incident through the news, but had not initially realised Ann was also a victim. She is expected to reach Kochi on Tuesday, and the funeral will be held after that,” Shaiby said. Another victim of the stampede was Athul Thambi, 24, from Koothattukulam in Ernakulam. He was the son of farm labourer Kochuparayil Thambi. Described as a brilliant student, Athul had previously been forced to abandon his studies due to the family’s financial crisis. He then got training from a polytechnic and started working as a supervisor. Later, he was able to quit his job and join CUSAT to study engineering. “Every weekend, he used to come home. But yesterday (Saturday), he informed his mother, Lilly, in the evening that he would be staying back at CUSAT campus this weekend,” said Koothattukulam municipal councillor Sunny Kuriakose. He has an elder brother Ajin, who is an engineer, Kuriakose said. At Thamarassery in Kozhikode, the Thuvakkunnil family was mourning the death of Sara Thomas, 20, another engineering student. Her father, Scaria Thomas, had been bitten by a snake a few months ago and had a long battle for his life, from which he only recently emerged. “Sara, a brilliant student, had got admission at other engineering colleges in Kerala. But the profile of CUSAT as a prestigious institution, and the fact that one of her relatives worked at the university, made the family choose that institute. Scaria Thomas is yet to recover fully from the health problems related to the snake bite. For several months since the snake bite last December, he fought for his life at hospital and later at home,’’ said their neighbour and CPI(M) worker Shamsudheen. Thomas, who had worked in the Gulf, had returned home a few years ago and was living with his family in a rented house. His wife, Kochurani, is a homemaker. They have two other daughters – the eldest is married and the youngest is a higher secondary student. The fourth victim of the tragedy, 23-year-old Alwin Joseph, was not a student. He was an electrician from Mundur in Palakkad, and had been staying in Kochi while looking for job opportunities. His father, Joseph, is a farm worker. Alwin’s plan was to eventually find a job and settle abroad. On Saturday, Alwin is thought to have gone to CUSAT for the music show. When his father saw the news of the stampede on TV, he called Alwin’s phone, but got no answer, said Mundur panchayat member K T Sabjalatha. “Later in the night, when they repeatedly called, someone picked up saying that they got the handset abandoned at the CUSAT venue. Soon, the tragedy was confirmed,” she said. ‘Delay in opening gate’ CUSAT Vice-Chancellor P G Sankaran said there were two factors that contributed to the stampede that took place after rain started pouring down. “There was a delay in opening the only gate to the auditorium. Hence, when students crowded at the only gate, it had to be opened all of a sudden. Besides, the stairs down to the amphitheatre are very steep,” he said.

Industries Minister P Rajeeve, who is also the MLA from Kalamassery where CUSAT is located, said after last month’s blast at a Jehovah’s Witnesses convention, the government had given directions to all auditoriums on the precautions to be taken.

Hundreds of BJP workers, led by party state president K Surendran and several senior leaders, accompanied Gopi to the police station and waited outside as officials started questioning the actor. On October 28, the Kozhikode city police had registered a case against Gopi under Section 354 A (sexual harassment of nature of unwelcome physical contact and explicit sexual overtures) based on a complaint from a journalist working with a TV channel. After the police served a notice to the actor, the BJP launched a campaign saying the party will not allow the government to target the leader, who is keen to contest the next Lok Sabha elections from Thrissur. The incident took place on October 27 when the actor-turned-politician was taking questions from reporters in Kozhikode. When the journalist asked Gopi a question, he put a hand on her shoulder and called her “mole (daughter)” as he began his answer. She backed away but when she asked another question later, he placed his hand on her shoulder once again, at which point she pushed it away. Following the controversy over the incident, Gopi apologised. In a Facebook post, he said that he had behaved in “an affectionate manner” towards the journalist. “If she felt bad about my behaviour, her feelings should be respected. I tender an apology towards her if she felt bad about my behaviour. Sorry…,” he said. However, the journalist said the apology was unacceptable and she would go ahead with the case.

A friend of four decades introduced himself, shared family photos, and details of their mutual friends. Soon, he got a WhatsApp call from that number, and the friend asked for Rs 40,000 for his sister’s surgery. As Radhakrishan remained noncommittal, the friend came on video call. In Radhakrishan’s mind, little doubt remained. It was his friend Venu Kumar, whom he had worked with in Coal India for decades before retiring. He sent him the money on GPay. By daybreak, Kerala’s first suspected AI deepfake fraud was born. Four months in, Kozhikode city police on Friday cracked the case, arresting one of the alleged accused, Shaik Murtuzamiya Hayat Bhai (43), from Mehsana in Gujarat. Police say he allegedly arranged fake bank accounts for the prime accused, Kaushal Shah from Ahmedabad, who is on the run. City police commissioner Rajpal Meena said this is the first arrest in a cyber crime using deepfake technology – wherein facial appearance is manipulated through deep generative methods. Prima facie, police believe Kaushal was the one who allegedly used deepfake technology to impersonate a friend of the complainant during a video call. Kozhikode cyber crime inspector Dinesh Koroth said the amount debited from the account was transferred to an account of a person in Ahmedabad. From there, it was transferred to the account of a gambling firm, where Kaushal is a regular. Eventually, the money would return to Kaushal as wins from gambling – a strategy employed to mislead police. Inspector Koroth said the police reached Shaik from Kaushal’s call detail records. According to them, Shaik maintained several bank accounts taken in the names of poor people who were not linked to the crime. “We have come to know that the accused were involved in cases of similar nature in Gujarat and Karnataka,” said the officer. Police said Kaushal is believed to have got details of the complainant and his friend from a WhatsApp group of former company employees. Kaushal, police said, is a B.Com graduate and comes from an affluent family. “We have learnt that his relatives and friends have complained about his cheating habit. Banks have also filed civil cases against him,” said the inspector. Recalling the incident on July 9, Radhakrishnan, who retired from Coal India 12 years ago as a senior executive, said he did not doubt when the person who sent a flurry of messages identified himself as Venu Kumar. “We had known each other for four decades. He started sending messages about my family and shared photos of his family. When I was going through these messages, I got a WhatsApp voice call from that number.” “There was no reason to doubt his voice, which I had been familiar with for decades. He told me that he was at Dubai airport and would reach Mumbai that evening. His sister was in hospital and Rs 40,000 was needed for surgery. He told me that he would return the money once he reached Mumbai. He asked me to transfer Rs 40,000 to a bystander’s account. When I started to raise doubts, he immediately made a video call. His image and voice were so clear that I had no reason to doubt things anymore. He WhatsApped a number, to which I credited the amount,” he said. Radhakrishan became suspicious after the fraudster demanded another Rs 35,000. “I felt something was fishy then. When he insisted on the second payment, I hung up the call.” Radhakrishan then made a call to Venu Kumar, who lives in Andhra Pradesh, on his phone number that he found on a WhatsApp group of former Coal India executives. “When I called Venu, he was excited to talk to me after many years. When I shot back that we had already talked in the morning and I had transferred money to him, he was stunned. Then I realised it was a scam, and I filed a complaint with the cyber police,’’ he said.","category":"kerala"},{"publishedAt":"2024-12-11","title":"We can’t be neutral when section of people face genocidal aggression, says Kerala CM on Israel-Palestine conflict","description":"\"Our Palestinian brothers are suffering.

We all know that with the support of America, Israel is targeting Palestine and the people there are facing genocidal aggression. We cannot take a neutral stand. We need to express our solidarity with the people of Palestine,” Vijayan said. He was speaking after inaugurating the concluding ceremony of the ‘Keraleeyam’ 2023 celebration which showcased the state’s progress, achievements, and cultural heritage to the world. Addressing the gathering here, Vijayan said the massive participation of the people shows that Keraleeyam was a huge success. The CM also said the government will consider the suggestions and directions received during the 25 seminars that took place during the last seven days, as part of the event. The week-long event was inaugurated on Kerala Piravi Day on November 1. Senior BJP leader O Rajagopal attended the event and witnessed the concluding ceremony. Meanwhile, opposition Congress-led UDF and the BJP boycotted the event altogether alleging that the Keralayeeam was a ‘financial extravaganza’. The Chief Minister, in his speech, reiterated that the Keraleeyam festival will be continued in coming years. The programme was organised within a short time period of 75 days, he pointed out. “We assure you that all the suggestions and directions that came from the seminars organised here will be considered for the further development of Kerala and its society,” Vijayan said. He stressed the need for more central assistance for further development in many sectors including the coastal area and its community. Vijayan also called for a change in the union government’s National Rubber Policy in order to protect the interests of rubber farmers and the sector. Finance Minister K Balagopal, who spoke at the event said the Kanakakunnu venue of the Keralayeem alone witnessed a footfall of over a lakh every day. “It shows that lakhs of people visited Keraleeyam and it will be a platform for the further development of the state,” he said. In an apparent reference to the Congress party, Balagopal said those who criticise the event should at least raise their voice against the central government, which was ‘refusing’ to pay what is due to the state government. With 42 venues, 25 seminars aimed at shaping the future of New Kerala, exhibitions, food festivals, and grand art performances, the festival showcased Kerala’s commitment to secularism, unity, and unique culture, according to the government. During his concluding day speech, Vijayan elaborated on the southern state’s notable accomplishments in various fields, including the cultural renaissance, land reform, people-centric planning, poverty amelioration, universal literacy, accessible public healthcare, housing provisions for all, and so on.","category":"kerala"},{"publishedAt":"2024-12-11","title":"Week after Kalamassery blasts, Jehovah’s Witnesses gather again for prayer meeting","description":"The Jehovah's Witnesses community in India boasts 947 congregations and over 56,000 devoted ministers dedicated to sharing their interpretation of the Bible and promoting an understanding of God's kingdom, according to the official jw.org website.","urlToImage":"https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/11/jehovah-witness-prayer-meeting.jpg?w=640","content":"Jehovah’s Witnesses, a Christian religious group whose prayer meeting in Kochi was marred by devastating bomb blasts a week ago, on Sunday resumed physical prayer meetings after holding online gatherings following the shocking incident that claimed the lives of three persons and injured over 50 others. The religious group decided to return to physical prayer meetings to remove any fear from its members’ minds following the blasts. The Jehovah’s Witnesses traces its origins to 19th century America. The group in Kalamassery faced a major shock when one of its estranged members — Dominic Martin — carried out multiple blasts at one of its conventions last Sunday by using an improvised explosive device (IED). Prior to surrendering before the police, Martin released a video stating that the group’s preachings were “seditious” and that they did not heed his warnings to change their ways, and that is why he carried out the attack. Three people, including a 12-year-old girl, lost their lives and over 50 were injured in the incident. Presently, according to a Health Department release, 20 persons are under treatment with 10 of them in intensive care and two in critical condition. The remaining eight persons are in the wards, it said. Subsequently, prayer meetings, usually held twice a week in local ‘Kingdom Halls’ — which refers to a local Jehovah’s Witnesses meeting place where religious services are held — were conducted online. “We decided to return to live (physical) meetings from today to remove the fear from people’s minds. The online meetings were held only for a few days following the blasts,” T A Sreekumar, a spokesperson of the group’s India Branch in Kerala, told PTI. On being asked whether there were any additional security arrangements in place for these meetings, he said that they already had a security system in place. “But we have asked everyone to be vigilant and cautious,” he added. Under the existing security system, members are examined before they enter the ‘Kingdom Halls’ and background checks are carried out of unknown persons, he said. “An enhanced security may be required in case of larger conventions and if the police say there need to be more security arrangements, we will ensure that,” Sreekumar said. The bomb blasts last Sunday took place on the last day of a three-day prayer convention held at Kalamassery here, which was attended by over 2,000 members from across the state. However, the prayer meetings at the ‘Kingdom Halls’ are much smaller affairs. “These are small gatherings of 50-60 members and everyone knows each other. No outsider can merely walk in like in churches or temples,” Sreekumar said. The Jehovah’s Witnesses community in India boasts 947 congregations and over 56,000 devoted ministers dedicated to sharing their interpretation of the Bible and promoting an understanding of God’s kingdom, according to the official jw.org website. Unlike mainstream Christian denominations, Jehovah’s Witnesses do not believe in the Holy Trinity (God, the Father; God, the Son – Jesus; and God the Holy Spirit) but worship Jehovah as the “the God of the Bible and the Creator of all things”. Followers of the group see Jesus Christ as the son of God, and not God himself. They learn from the teachings and examples set by Christ; hence they consider themselves Christians.","category":"kerala"},{"publishedAt":"2024-12-11","title":"Food vlogger found dead at his residence in Kerala","description":"The vlogger was part of 'Eat Kochi Eat', a popular online platform for foodies in which they introduce the least explored food joints in the city.","urlToImage":"https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/11/vlogger.jpg?w=640","content":"Noted food vlogger from Kochi, Rahul N Kutty, was found dead at his residence on Saturday, police said.

Today also, he got up early and went out on his two-wheeler. His wife thought he was going to meet his friend as he had told her the previous night,” said Sakkir Thammanam, the local councillor who is one of the very few people in the locality who can claim to know Martin, said to be aged 57. Hours after the blasts at a convention centre that left three dead, as of now, and several injured, Martin, an estranged member of Jehovah’s Witnesses, posted a video on social media taking responsibility for the act. Martin and his family – wife, son and daughter – have been staying at a 2-bedroom house at Khader Lane for rent for the last five years. Their landlord, Jaleel, was shell-shocked.

He might have started drinking of late as per our our conversations with his wife. Also, he never defaulted on rent payment. There was nothing suspicious about his activities,” said Jaleel. “I had been following the news of the blasts from the morning and suddenly in the afternoon, his wife came down and told me about his video in which he took ownership of the crime. She was apologetic that because of him, there would be so much issues for us and all the people in the locality,” added Jaleel. Martin, who hails from Elamkulam in Kochi, studied only till Class 10, as per Sakkir’s knowledge. Dominic left Jehovah’s Witnesses five or six years ago and returned to the group about two months ago. “He was running a spoken English tutorial in Thammanam a few years ago. When that started to taper off, he went to the Gulf more than two years ago. He came back just a couple of months ago and was planning to start some shop if I reckon right,” said Sakkir, adding that Martin is the youngest of seven siblings. Since the news of his confession and arrest broke out, his wife and daughter have been shattered. “They have not eaten anything. We have been constantly keeping in touch with them and trying to give them all the support. It’s nothing of their fault that he did this act,” said Jaleel. Elamkulam is his hometown. He came back from Gulf after his daughter contracted dengue. He never had any issues wtith anyone.","category":"kerala"},{"publishedAt":"2024-12-11","title":"Kochi Convention Centre Blasts Highlights: All-party meet resolves to resist efforts to create intolerance, mistrust","description":"Kochi Convention Centre Blasts Highlights: A series of blasts took place at a hall in Kalamassery in Kochi.

The government’s clarification came amidst a raging row over financial transactions between Vijayan’s daughter T Veena’s firm and the minerals company. The Department of State Goods and Services Tax on Saturday informed Congress MLA Mathew Kuzhalnadan, who had raised corruption allegations against Veena, that the matter had been verified. Kuzhalnadan had raised corruption charges against the transaction between Veena’s firm and the Kochi-based minerals company. He had sought to know whether Veena had remitted IGST for the over Rs 1 crore that she had received from the minerals company. He also recently sought a vigilance probe into the corruption allegations. In a letter, the state tax department informed the Congress legislator that during the verification, it was found that the Veena’s company had remitted the IGST for the amount that she received from Cochin Minerals and Rutile Ltd. However, the brief letter didn’t mention any other details, including the amount she had paid as tax. Sources here said the GST Commissioner has already submitted a report in this regard to Finance Minister K N Balagopal. A controversy erupted in Kerala recently over some financial transactions between the Kochi-based private minerals company and Veena and her IT firm. Evidence also cropped up that showed the company had dealings with top leaders of both the ruling CPI(M) as well as the opposition Congress-led UDF. The issue came to the fore after a Malayalam daily reported that Cochin Minerals and Rutile Ltd paid a total of Rs 1.72 crore to the CM’s daughter between 2017 and 2020.

When I was researching universities, I was weighing so many factors. I wanted a place where I could challenge myself intellectually while feeling at home in a new environment. Strathclyde kept popping up in my search, and when I found out it held the “triple crown” accreditation — AMBA, EQUIS, and AACSB — since 2004, I felt like I had found something special. I had other options from the University of San Francisco and Penn State to Dundee, Sheffield, and Southampton. But another reason to pick Strathclyde Business School, besides their ranking, is Glasgow. I read about its friendliness, the mix of tradition and modernity, and I could see myself fitting right in. Glasgow has a reputation for being one of the happiest places to live in the UK. Shifting to a new country My first days in Glasgow felt like stepping into a world that was both excitingly new and, thanks to the people around me, unexpectedly warm and familiar. Having my parents with me when I first arrived was a gift. They stayed for nearly a month, which gave me this gentle bridge between the comfort of home and the unknowns of living abroad. My dad went out of his way to make sure I felt supported —walking me to the university to pick up my biometric residence card (BRP) and dropping me off at my first few classes. READ | University of Strathclyde announces Faculty of Science Scholarship for January 2025 intake One of my first solo outings was to a nearby Starbucks. I didn’t know what to expect, and that tiny sense of loneliness had just started to creep in. But the woman behind the counter noticed I was new, struck up the warmest conversation, and shared how much she loved Indian food, telling me, “You’re so welcome here.” Then came Freshers’ Week, which truly made me feel like I belonged. In the midst of this, the accommodation staff played a huge role too, organising events that made it easy to find my footing and connect with other students. They guided me in a way that made me feel not just welcomed but seen. Ambe with friends of University of Strathclyde, Glasgow. Of course, there were funny little challenges too. Grocery shopping became an adventure of its own — mentally converting pounds to rupees every time I picked something up or trying to figure out the taste difference between white and red onions. These tiny discoveries, though sometimes laughable, marked my gradual transition into a new lifestyle. Having my brother in Glasgow when I moved here added a layer of support, however, we ended up in separate accommodations, just five minutes apart. Ambe with her brother at The University of Glasgow. Earning while studying — tiring but necessary Managing the cost of living as a student in Glasgow has been both a challenge and an opportunity for personal growth. Early on, I realised that balancing expenses would require me to be proactive, so I decided to take on part-time roles that not only support me financially but also enrich my university experience. I became a student ambassador at the University of Strathclyde, where I represent the university during Open Days, Applicant Visits, and key recruitment events. This role has been more than just a job; it’s allowed me to connect with prospective students and their families, share my own journey, and develop valuable communication and public speaking skills. Engaging with people from diverse backgrounds has been incredibly rewarding and has deepened my connection to the university community. Also read | How can I study in a top country on a budget? Scholarships, loans In addition, I took on a content creation role with the university’s Recruitment and International Office. Here, I apply my passion for marketing and media by producing videos that showcase the vibrancy of student life at Strathclyde. This position not only helps with living expenses but also allows me to build a portfolio aligned with my studies in marketing. It’s been fulfilling to see my work contribute to the university’s outreach and to know that I’m helping prospective students feel excited about joining our community. Balancing these roles with my academic commitments has taught me a lot about time management and prioritizing what’s important. While it can be demanding at times, the experience has been incredibly rewarding. How studying abroad changed me…and those around me Studying abroad has undoubtedly changed my outlook on life and, interestingly, has also influenced how people back home perceive me. Being immersed in a new culture and living independently has brought out a side of me that’s more resilient and adaptable. The experience has allowed me to understand not only my own journey but also to appreciate the journeys of those around me. Back home, I’ve noticed that people interact with me a bit differently. Friends and family seem more confident in my abilities, often commenting on how I’ve become more mature and self-assured. They see me as someone who’s more grounded, able to handle challenges with a sense of calm and clarity.

However, with the launch of a three-year BA (Hons) programme from 2025, the institution is now diversifying its academic portfolio with non-legal programmes. While these initiatives aim to transform NLSIU into a multidisciplinary university, they have raised eyebrows over whether the institution is overstretching its reach and drifting away from its founding principle of being a pioneering legal institution. Since its inception in 1988, the NLSIU has adopted the five-year integrated BA.LLB programme conceptualised by N R Madhava Menon, who is considered the father of modern legal education in the country. The programme’s interdisciplinary approach, combining law with humanities and social sciences, has been a benchmark for legal education, inspiring other law schools across India. However, with an evolving higher education landscape and increasing competition from private universities, the NLSIU is now seeking to redefine itself as a multidisciplinary university as part of its expansion plans. In fact, the Karnataka government has agreed to provide additional seven acres of land in the Jnanabharati campus of Bangalore University to NLSIU for a period of 30 years on lease rent basis at Rs 50,000 per acre per annum. Currently, NLSIU is functioning in a 23-acre campus inside the BU campus. Read | NLSIU Bengaluru to introduce three-year BA (Hons) programme from 2025 The NLS BA is designed to include a common core series of foundational courses jointly offered to all first-year students across the BA and BA LLB programmes; option of selecting a major-minor track or a double major track in the disciplines of History, Sociology and Anthropology, Politics, Economics; learning a selection of Indian languages; and practice courses in areas such as AI and Machine Learning, Filmmaking, Business Consulting, User Experience Research, Digital Journalism, Creative Writing, Entrepreneurship, Policy Advocacy and Analysis. Read | Top 10 law colleges in India: NIRF 2024 Rankings NLSIU Vice-Chancellor Sudhir Krishnaswamy said that while the institution made attempts to modify and reshape the curriculum over the years, the changes have not been comprehensive. “The BA programme in India has traditionally been seen as a generalist degree. Unfortunately, this has often led to weaker academic and graduate outcomes in some universities. While there are some notable successes — such as strong honours programmes at Central universities and a few private universities offering innovative, specialised BA programmes — the overall model has struggled,” Krishnaswamy said. “At NLS, we aim to reposition the BA as a highly aspirational degree, accessible through a public institution. We are not replicating existing models like those of Delhi University or private universities. Instead we are designing a programme that is responsive to contemporary needs and skill sets and professionally oriented with the demands of the 21st century,” he said. Dr Mohan Gopal, former Director of the National Judicial Academy, said that transforming legal education with a tinge of multidisciplinary approach should not come at the expense of jeopardising the operations of the legal system. “I personally feel the study of law has to be interdisciplinary and intersectional. However, it has to be done within the objectives of the NLSIU Act and the founding purpose. The introduction of multidisciplinary programmes must be done within the framework of Article 39A of the Indian Constitution. The Article requires the state to ensure that the legal system operates to promote justice based on equal opportunity. Therefore, any academic programme, legal and non-legal, should be guided by the provisions of Article 39,” Gopal said. “Introduction of a BA (Hons) programme should not be for the purpose of revenue generation or a profit making enterprise. Instead it should focus on strengthening the operations of the legal system to ensure justice. Additionally, the multidisciplinary programmes should also focus on considering political, social and historical dimensions to ensure justice. At a time when democracy is silenced and the Constitution under threat, it is the role of NLS to prioritise protecting democracy and the law through the business of justice and not the business of education,” he said. However the university believes that the introduction of the BA (Hons) programme will not have any adverse effect on the efficacy of the integrated five-year BA.LLB programme. “To address this, let us return to the founding principles of the university in 1988. The university’s success was built on its ability to integrate multidisciplinary education into the study of law. This is evident in the core BA.LLB programme, which combines a Bachelor of Arts and a Bachelor of Laws, excelling in both components rather than focusing on one at the expense of the other. The MPP programme, introduced in 2014, reflects this foundational ethos. As for the new BA programme, it has been designed to complement the BA.LLB programme. From the outset, both programmes have been conceptualised to run in parallel, creating an interconnected academic ecosystem. A strong BA programme enhances the intellectual environment of the university and supports the continued strength of the BA.LLB programme,” Krishnaswamy said. “The introduction of non-legal programmes like the MPP and BA Honors is not a departure from NLS’s core mission but rather an expansion of its multidisciplinary vision. Far from diminishing the integrated BA.LLB programme, these additions are likely to enhance its relevance and impact by fostering a more dynamic and diverse academic culture,” he said. Further, the institution also highlighted that the NLS faculty size has seen a three-fold growth in size and has recorded a 235% growth in student body. Additionally, the social science faculty has also seen a five-fold increase with a leaning towards sociology, university officials stated. Going ahead, the university is also in talks to introduce majors in philology, literature and arts and culture.","category":"education"},{"publishedAt":"2024-12-11","title":"CUET-UG to be fully online, students can choose any subject: UGC chief","description":"The UGC also announced that the number of subjects will be reduced from 63 to 37 and admissions for programmes in dropped subjects will be based on the General Aptitude Test (GAT) scores.","urlToImage":"https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/12/cuet_3c8be9.jpg?w=640","content":"Following recommendations by an expert panel, the CUET-UG from next year will be a computer-based test (CBT), a shift from the earlier hybrid mode, and students will be allowed to appear for subjects irrespective of subjects studied in Class 12, said University Grants Commission (UGC) Chairperson M Jagadesh Kumar on Tuesday.

A compulsory-answer format offers a more comprehensive and uniform assessment of their knowledge and abilities as all candidates are evaluated on the same set of questions.

It should be noted that there is also no global agreement on the definition of online learning. THE has explained that this pilot ranking measures only the parts of universities that deliver online learning, which means the courses are advertised as “online” and at least 40 per cent of the content is delivered online. In this pilot edition, THE used 17 metrics grouped into four pillars: resources, which measures the staff and resources devoted to online learning; engagement, which has six metrics, including student survey responses to compare the level of student engagement; outcomes, which measures student progression and whether they would recommend it to others; and environment, which tracks inclusion, diversity and support levels. The US’ University of Central Florida (gold) is top globally for resources, while New Zealand’s Massey University (gold) achieves the highest scores for both engagement and environment. Ukraine’s Sumy State University is awarded silver but gains the highest score globally for outcomes. Among those awarded gold, India’s O.P. Jindal Global University achieves the best outcomes score.

Meanwhile, the wait of one lonely pen for its rightful claimant continues at the ‘Table Office’, the section of Parliament where all things lost – and almost all found – land up in the House. Time being an exception. “Most members are quietly returned their belongings. Currently, there is just that unclaimed pen lying in the Table Office. Everything else has been returned,” a Parliament security staff member says, adding that it has been lying with them since the last Session. The case of recovered cash, announced by Rajya Sabha Chairman Jagdeep Dhankhar himself in the House and disowned completely by Singhvi, is unusual not just in that aspect. In the usual course, sources say, when an article is found inside Parliament, it is easily traced back, and the MP concerned “immediately informed”. If the MP is still at Parliament House, it is returned then and there. If not, it makes its way to the Table Office, the administrative wing of Parliament which looks after the running of the House, from where MPs can collect their belongings. In the old Parliament, such goods also made their way to the Parliament Security Office, a small 10X10 ft space on the first floor. All such duties are now handled by the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF), which took over from the Parliament Security Service in the wake of the December 2023 incident, when three visitors smuggled in smoke canisters into the Lok Sabha and burst them in the House. Over the years, much stuff has passed through their hands, say security officials of Parliament – most frequently, misplaced wedding cards, invitation cards, letters addressed to ministers, Parliament debate papers, chits on party floor strategy, keys, phones, laptops and jewellery. Finding cash is also common, going up to a few thousand of rupees; “wads of currency”, traced or untraced, a first. “The protocol is so tight that even a Rs 2 coin left behind on a desk is returned to the rightful owner,” says an official. Behind several recoveries, lie stories. Older staff from the Parliament Security Services recount how they once found an open laptop in the Rajya Sabha, and realised it belonged to then BJP MP Arun Shourie. The UPA was in power at the time. Also Read | Singhvi seeks probe into RS notes incident, says enclosures needed to prevent planting ‘ganja’ “We found he was writing a book. We informed Shourie ji’s PA, who said the member would come the next day to pick it up. But Shourie ji arrived the same night. The staff told him the office was closed, but he requested that it be opened and the laptop be handed over to him as all his data was on it,” an official says. As per security protocol, officials go through possessions to determine ownership – among other things – unless they are sealed. Then there are things they are now well acquainted with, given the number of times they have stumbled onto them, such as Samajwadi Party Rajya Sabha MP Jaya Bachchan’s candy box. “She often carries this box that she passes around in the House, sharing candies with other MPs. She has left it behind many times and it has been returned to her the next day,” says an official. The letters recovered in the House mostly deal with requests regarding transfer and posting of officials, while the chits are the ones parties use to inform MPs of a change in floor strategy in the middle of a sitting. “These days, we find fewer wedding cards as MPs now receive the same in digital form on their phones,” the official says. The stuff turns up during the “anti-sabotage checks” carried out in the two Houses by Parliament security – earlier this was done twice daily, before the Houses sat and after they adjourned for the day. Since the CISF took over, multiple anti-sabotage checks are common, any time an adjournment happens. As per Dhankhar, the currency on Singhvi’s chair was found during one such sweep of the Rajya Sabha. There have been instances when MPs have themselves approached the Parliament Security Office or the Table Office searching for something they can’t find. An official admits it can get awkward “when claims on articles not in our possession are made”. “We have to then go through the entire CCTV footage and conduct a proper investigation. But in most of these cases, members come back to say they were mistaken and they had found the lost item at home.” The CISF officer says that in case security checks turn up articles that can be traced back to owners, they put tags with the name on them, and hand them to the Table Office. “Phones are easy to return, jewellery takes time. Recently, a member lost her earring. She showed us the identical other earring she had. It was given back to her.” However, whether traced back or not, the security officials do not remember any instance of announcement being made in the House regarding a discovered article, as done by Dhankhar last Friday. Of all the stories, one fascinates an old-timer the most – the time they found a mobile phone with a camera. “It belonged to (National Conference president) Farooq Abdullah sahab. Those were the days when incoming calls were also charged and extremely few people had mobile phones, let alone phones with cameras. For most of that day, the staff kept discussing the phone. The next day, it was returned to the MP.”","category":"politics"},{"publishedAt":"2024-12-11","title":"‘Thank those who backed me’: Mamata message to INDIA bloc leaders over her leadership claim","description":"Bengal Cong attacks TMC chief, alleging that her bid is part of a “BJP conspiracy” to create rifts within INDIA alliance","urlToImage":"https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/12/ch1883953_20241211132222.jpg?w=640","content":"In a move which is likely to widen the fissures within the INDIA bloc, West Bengal Chief Minister and Trinamool Congress (TMC) supremo Mamata Banerjee on Wednesday thanked the Opposition leaders who supported her after she expressed her willingness to lead the alliance.

Bengal Congress chief Subhankar Sarkar however alleged that Mamata’s statements were a part of the BJP’s conspiracy to create rifts within the INDIA bloc. “Recently the Chief Minister of West Bengal @MamataOfficial ji in an interview apparently expressed her desire to lead the I.N.D.I.A. alliance. Any alliance partner may claim and want to lead the I.N.D.I.A alliance. However, Mamata Banerjee ji’s action has on several occasions provided oxygen to the BJP and derailed a united Opposition front when the BJP is in crisis,” he said in a post on X. Alleging that the move to stake claim over the bloc’s leadership was nothing but a divisive mechanism to provide advantage to the BJP, Sarkar added: “The ‘I’ in INDIA alliance stands for inclusive and every decision of the alliance should be collective in fighting the BJP through a common minimum programme.” Another “surprised” Congress leader said the TMC had not been attending the meetings of the INDIA bloc in Parliament. “When we ask them, their leaders claim the TMC is not in the INDIA bloc. And then Mamata says she is ready to lead the alliance… it is surprising,” the leader said. Since the run-up to the Lok Sabha polls, the Congress and the TMC have been on a collision course. After initial deliberations over fighting the polls together, Mamata went ahead and announced candidates for all 42 parliamentary seats in the state. The Congress and the CPM-led Left Front fought the polls together. While the TMC won 29 seats as against the BJP’s 12, the Congress managed to win just one seat with the Left drawing a blank. The demand for a change in leadership of the Opposition bloc surfaced after the Congress’s dismal showing in the Jammu and Kashmir and Haryana Assembly polls with some INDIA constituents accusing the Congress of not “taking its allies” along. Also Read | Congress woes grow as Lalu backs Mamata on INDIA bloc leadership: ‘Let her take it … doesn’t matter if Congress objects’ The chorus gained momentum after the drubbing of the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA), of which the Congress is a part, in the Maharashtra elections. One of the first voices seeking a change of guard came just two days after the Maharashtra poll results on November 25, when the TMC’s Kalyan Banerjee urged the Congress leaders to “keep their egos aside” and recognise Mamata as the “natural leader of the INDIA bloc”. Last week, Mamata said in an interview to a regional television channel that she had formed the INDIA bloc and it was now up to those leading the front to manage it. “If they cannot run the show, what can I do? If given the opportunity, I would ensure its smooth functioning. I can run it from here (Bengal),” she said. Her comments immediately created ripples. First, Pawar appeared to endorse her leadership, saying, “She is a capable leader and has the right to say it. The MPs she has sent to Parliament are hardworking and good.” Joining the chorus later was Lalu, who said Mamata must be allowed to lead the INDIA bloc. On being asked if the Congress would object to it, he quipped: “It doesn’t matter… Mamata ko de do (Give the bloc’s responsibility to Mamata).” The INDIA alliance is likely staring at a tough time ahead with three of its largest parties – Congress, SP and TMC – slugging it out over the leadership issue and other partners like the Shiv Sena (UBT) and NCP(SP) looking to calibrate their stances.","category":"politics"},{"publishedAt":"2024-12-11","title":"Nehru on no-trust motion against first Speaker: ‘Exhibition of incompetence, frivolity… vicious’","description":"Oppn moved a resolution against Speaker Mavalankar on December 18, 1954, alleging he was partial and backed govt; LS has seen three no-trust motions against the Speaker so far, all of which failed","urlToImage":"https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/12/first-speaker-1.jpg?w=640","content":"The Opposition INDIA bloc submitted a notice Tuesday for bringing a resolution for removal of Vice-President of India Jagdeep Dhankar, who is also the ex-officio Chairperson of the Rajya Sabha, accusing him of being “explicitly partisan” in conducting the proceedings of the House and acting as an “impassioned spokesperson” of the government’s policies at public fora. While this is the first such move against the Rajya Sabha Chairman in India’s parliamentary history, the Lok Sabha has witnessed three no-confidence motions to remove the Speaker since Independence. The first motion was moved against India’s first Speaker G V Mavalankar on December 18, 1954 by Vigneshwar Missir, Socialist Party MP from Bihar, with Deputy Speaker A Ayyangar in the Chair. The motion was rejected by the House after an acrimonious two-hour debate. The second motion was moved on November 24, 1966, against the then Speaker Sardar Hukum Singh by socialist leader Madhu Limaye, with Deputy Speaker S V Krishnamoorthy Rao in the Chair. As fewer than 50 members rose to back it, the motion was not taken up. The third motion was moved on April 15, 1987, for the removal of Speaker Balram Jakhar by CPI (M) MP Somnath Chatterjee, with Deputy Speaker Thambi Durai in the Chair. This motion was also rejected by the House. As per Article 94 of the Constitution, the Lok Sabha Speaker can be removed by a resolution of the Lok Sabha passed by a majority of the then members of the House. At least 14 days’ notice has to be given of the intention to move such a resolution in writing to the Secretary General. The member who gave the notice moves the resolution on a date assigned after 14 days of the notice. The Chair — generally the Deputy Speaker, as the Speaker cannot preside over the House when a motion for his removal is taken up — places the motion before the House and asks whether leave be granted to take it up, adding that members who wish that the motion be taken up rise in their seats. If not less than 50 members rise accordingly, the Chair declares that leave is granted for the House to consider the resolution on a particular day. However, the removal of the Speaker takes place on that day only if a majority of the then members vote for his removal — an uphill task given that the government of the day enjoys a majority in the Lok Sabha. Failed bid to remove Mavalankar The first move to impeach the presiding officer of a House of Parliament took place as early as 1954, when the Opposition members sought the removal of Lok Sabha Speaker Mavalankar. On December 18, 1954, the Lok Sabha took up the Opposition’s motion after the Deputy Speaker said that he was admitting it despite it not being properly worded because it pertained to an important matter. Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru requested that given the nature of the motion, the Opposition should be given more time to speak than the Treasury benches. “In this particular case, more time should be allowed to the Opposition than the government benches,” Nehru said. The resolution, moved by Vigneshwar Missir, alleged that the Speaker was not impartial, that he did not allow members to exercise their rights as MPs, and that he openly supported the government version of issues over the one presented by the Opposition members. So, it added, the House wanted him removed from the Chair. Participating in the debate, S S More, the MP from Sholapur belonging to the Peasants and Workers Party, accused the Speaker of disallowing adjournment motion notices by the Opposition members on important matters. “We have till now moved about 89 adjournment motions, and out of them, two were not pressed and only one was allowed… Barring these three, 86 adjournment motions have been disallowed,” More said, seeing this as a sign that the Speaker was not impartial. Speaking for the motion, A K Gopalan of the CPI said that adjournment motions were not allowed, charging that the Speaker had after his election to the post openly called himself a party man. He also accused the Speaker of being partisan as he accepted the version of the Home Ministry regarding violence and firing in Kurnool when a Communist members’ procession was passing through a lane inhabited by Congress workers, leading to injuries sustained by a Communist MP. He said that when another CPI MP raised the matter in the House, the Speaker sided with the government and disallowed his adjournment motion notice. Sardar Hukum Singh opposed the resolution, saying that there was not a single instance where the Speaker could be proved to be biased or incompetent, though he was also human and not infallible. He, thus, disagreed with the move to remove Mavalankar. He added that as for the incident of firing in Kurnool, law and order was a state subject and the Speaker was well within his rights to disallow a discussion over it. N B Khare of the Hindu Mahasabha said that he did not get a chance to ask questions on a number of important issues as he did not get permission for the same from the Speaker. “Here are about two dozen death warrants of my poor dry dead questions,” he exclaimed, drawing words of rebuke from the Deputy Speaker. Intervening in the debate, Prime Minister Nehru said that there was no whip on any member of the ruling Congress, and they could vote as they wished, as this was a matter concerning the honour of the House. He then expressed anguish over the bona fides of the Speaker being questioned, saying, “When we challenge his bona fides we betray before our countrymen and indeed before the world that we are little men and that is the seriousness of the situation.” Defending Mavalankar, Nehru debunked the allegation of the Opposition members that he did not allow adjournment motions. Asserting that the House of Commons in Britain saw adjournment motion notices being given once or twice a year, he said the Lok Sabha saw three such notices being given in just a day. “A motion for adjournment is a valued and precious right. But every valued and precious right can be so misused as to become a nuisance, and lose all its value. You debase it if you use it in that way,” Nehru said. He added that while he did not want to use any harsh words about the things said by the Opposition members, he was “amazed at this extraordinary exhibition from the other side”. “It was an exhibition of incompetence, frivolity and lack of substance. It is astounding,” Nehru said. Regarding the Speaker not accepting questions from the Opposition members, Nehru said there was no dearth of questions in Parliament. “In fact, we cannot deal with all of them. Can you imagine the amount of time and money that is spent on gathering facts for answering twenty or thirty thousand questions? The whole apparatus of the government is functioning like that. Daily telegrams are going all over the country to get facts,” he said. Regarding the no-confidence resolution against the Speaker signed by Opposition members, the first PM said, “It is a vicious thing they have signed. I doubt whether the persons have read it before they signed it.” Nehru then targeted the Communist MPs, saying that he did not expect any sense of responsibility from them, “but I do expect, even according to their proclamations elsewhere, that they do not believe in democracy or the democratic set-up”. A K Gopalan hit back at Nehru, saying, “We have come here because democracy is in your pocket and we understood that democracy has to be shared.” Nehru responded, saying “I hope Shri Gopalan will repeat that every morning so that gradually it might have some effect on his thinking and action.” Nehru said that to ask any member to support the resolution would be to suppose that the member has no intelligence. The motion was then put to vote and rejected.","category":"politics"},{"publishedAt":"2024-12-11","title":"Judge’s anti-Muslim remarks: Oppn MPs start signing on notice for impeachment","description":"Motion may be moved as early as Thursday, though INDIA doesn’t have the numbers to get it passed in either House","urlToImage":"https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/12/india-bloc-protest.jpg?w=640","content":"The Opposition INDIA bloc parties in Rajya Sabha are preparing to give notice for moving a motion to impeach Allahabad High Court judge Justice Shekhar Kumar Yadav following his controversial and derogatory remarks about Muslims at an event organised by the Vishwa Hindu Parishad last week. Sources said as many as 36 Opposition MPs across parties have already signed the petition, initiated by Independent Rajya Sabha MP and lawyer Kapil Sibal, and the Opposition may move it Thursday after organising more signatures. The INDIA bloc has 85 MPs in Rajya Sabha. Among those who have already signed include the Congress’s Digvijaya Singh, Jairam Ramesh and Vivek Tankha; AAP’s Sanjay Singh; TMC’s Saket Gokhale and Sagarika Ghose; RJD’s Manoj Kumar Jha; SP’s Javed Ali Khan; CPI(M)’s John Brittas and the CPI’s Sandosh Kumar. The notice seeks initiation of proceedings for impeachment of Justice Yadav under section 3 (1) (B) of The Judges (Inquiry) Act read with Article 124 (4) and Article 124 (5) of the Constitution. As per the Judges Inquiry Act, 1968, a complaint against a judge has to be made through a resolution signed at least by 100 members if moved in Lok Sabha and by 50 MPs if initiated in Rajya Sabha. Sources in the Opposition camp said they will attach video clips and transcripts of Justice Yadav’s controversial speech along with links of news articles on it. Also Read | Allahabad HC judge backs Uniform Civil Code at VHP event Once the MPs submit the motion, the presiding officer of the House can either accept or reject it. If accepted, a three-member committee, comprising two judges and a jurist, is constituted to probe the complaint and determine if it is a case fit for initiating the process of impeachment. The committee includes one judge from the Supreme Court and the Chief Justice of a High Court if the complaint is against a High Court judge, or two Supreme Court judges if the complaint is against a sitting judge of the apex court. As Article 124 (4) of the Constitution says, the motion for impeachment “has to be supported by a majority of the total membership of that House and by a majority of not less than two-third of the members of the House present and voting” – in both Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha. Given the majority enjoyed by the NDA bloc in both Houses, the motion of impeachment is unlikely to clear either Lok Sabha or Rajya Sabha. So far there have been four attempts to impeach High Court judges and two to remove Supreme Court judges, with the last being in 2018 against then Chief Justice of India Dipak Misra. None of the motions cleared the entire process. Addressing an event organised by the VHP’s legal cell on the Allahabad High Court premises Sunday, Justice Yadav, while backing the Uniform Civil Code strongly, targeted Muslims and said “you have a misconception that if a law (UCC) is brought in, it will be against your Shariyat, your Islam and your Quran… But I want to say one more thing… whether it is your personal law, our Hindu law, your Quran or whether it is our Gita, as I said we have addressed the ills (buraaiyan) in our practices… kamiyan thi durust kar liye hai (the shortcomings have been addressed) …untouchability… sati, jauhar… female foeticide…we have addressed all those issues… Then why are you not doing away with his law… that while your first wife is there…you can have three wives… without her consent… that is not acceptable.” Also Read | Supreme Court takes note of Justice Yadav’s remarks backing UCC at VHP event, seeks details from Allahabad High Court He then went on to say “it is taught to us that even a small animal should not be killed.

Hame kisi ka kasht dekh karke kasht hota hai… kisike peeda ko dekhke peeda hota hai… par aapke andar nahin hoti hai… Why? Because when a child is born in our community, they are taught about God, the Vedas and Mantras right from the childhood… they are told about non-violence… lekin aap ke yahan toh bachpan se bache ko saamne rakh kar ke vadh kiya jaat hai pashuon ka (in your community, animals are slaughtered in the presence of children)… toh aap kaise apeksha karte hain ki sahishnu hoga woh… udaar hoga woh (how do you expect the person to become tolerant, generous).” Justice Yadav said, “I have no hesitation in saying that this is Hindustan… and the country will run according to the majority who live in Hindustan.” He said the “law will operate on the will of the majority… if you look at families or the society… the will of the majority prevails.” He said “the people who we are talking about… all of them are not bad… Not all of them are bad and the ills that I am talking about… they are not in favour of four wives, they are not in favour of triple talaq, they are not in favour of female foeticide… Lekin jo … (derogatory remark)… kyunoki woh desh ke liye ghatak hai (dangerous to the country)… Janata ko bhadkane wale log hain, desh aage na bade is prakar ke log hain (those who incite people, who do not want the country to progress) … unse sawdhan rahne ki zaroorat hai (need to be on guard against them).”","category":"politics"},{"publishedAt":"2024-12-11","title":"TDP’s Rajya Sabha ranks set to include businessman once at heart of internal CBI war","description":"Sathish Babu Sana among two names nominated by party and set to win unopposed.

With no other candidates against them, both will win unopposed. Outside Andhra, Sana is best known for accusing then CBI special director Rakesh Asthana in 2018 of taking a bribe of Rs 3 crore to let him off in a case related to controversial meat-exporter Moin Qureshi. The complaint had triggered an all out CBI versus CBI war with then director Alok Verma booking Asthana and ordering a probe against him, forcing the agency to send both officers on leave. In June 2019, Sana was arrested by the Enforcement Directorate in connection with Qureshi money laundering case and is currently out on bail, after the ED filed a chargesheet naming him. Also Read | Delhi HC upholds money laundering probe against businessmen Sathish Babu Sana, Pradeep Koneru The TDP, which is now an ally of the ruling BJP at the Centre, calls the charges part of a “political conspiracy”. Sources in the TDP said that Sana was picked due to his proximity to the top TDP leadership. “Though he does not have any political experience, he has been in the vicinity of politics for a long time,” a source said. A native of Kakinada, Sana started his career as an employee of the Andhra Pradesh Electricity Board before quitting and moving to Hyderabad, where he floated a number of companies like Gold Coast Properties Private Limited, Rasama Estates, Matrix Natural Resources Private Limited and East Godavari Breweries Private Limited. Since his foray into business, he has been known to be close to leaders of the YSR Congress Party (YSRCP), Congress and TDP. “Locals started to refer to him as ‘lightning Sana’ after he went up an electricity pole during a storm in Kakinada to repair it. He has always thought about the well-being of Kakinda’s people,” a TDP leader in Kakinada said. Sana has also dabbled with sports administration and served as the secretary of the East Godavari Cricket Association for a short while before becoming its lifetime member, and as a museum committee member of the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI). Every year, he organises the Sana Sathish Babu Cricket Championship. On why Sana was preferred over at least 10 senior TDP leaders seen to be aspirants, sources said: “Firstly, the information that 10 leaders were in the reckoning (for a Rajya Sabha berth) is wrong. Only Mopidevi garu was in the race but he himself opted out saying he was more suited to Andhra than Delhi. Hence, we looked at Sana. The allegations against him have not been proven. There are many members of Parliament who have allegations against them,” a source said. Another leader said that if the allegations are proven, the party will take action against Sana. “Just like Koneti Adimulam (TDP Sathyavedu MLA) was suspended (over allegations of sexual harassment), the party is firm that it will act against wrongdoings of its members,” the leader said. Asked about the TDP naming Sana for the Rajya Sabha, sources in the BJP said it was the party’s “internal matter”. The other Rajya Sabha nominee of the TDP, Nellore-born Masthan Rao, is the Chairman of BMR Industries, one of the largest shrimp exporters in the country. Seen to be a tall leader of the Andhra Yadav community, he went to Guntur university with YSR Congress Party (YSRCP) Rajya Sabha MP V Vijayasai Reddy. He made his Assembly poll debut in 2009 from the Kavali segment, where he defeated the Congress’s Vishnuvardhan Reddy by around 19,000 votes. After his election as an MLA, he tasked his cousin Beedha Ravichandra, who was seen as close to TDP chief N Chandrababu Naidu and an MLC, with managing his cadre and other local issues as he went on to become the most prominent Yadav face of the TDP in the state. Despite his loss in the 2014 Assembly elections, he was made an advisory member of the Andhra Pradesh Capital Region Development Authority (APCRDA) between 2014 and 2019. He contested the 2019 Lok Sabha polls from the Nellore Lok Sabha seat but lost to Addala Prabhakar Reddy of the YSRCP. According to sources, after his defeat, Rao was eyeing a Rajya Sabha berth besides the Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams (TTD) chairman’s post, and shifted to the YSRCP in December 2019 after being overlooked for both posts. In June this year, Rao’s daughter Beedha Madhuri allegedly drove her BMW car over a 22-year-old man sleeping on a pavement in Chennai. She subsequently surrendered before a local police station and was granted bail. For the third vacant Rajya Sabha seat from Andhra, the BJP has announced R Krishnaiah. He too will be elected unopposed. The main Opposition party YSRCP has just 11 MLAs in the 175-member House and cannot win a Rajya Sabha seat.","category":"politics"},{"publishedAt":"2024-12-11","title":"Amid churn in TN Dalit politics, DMK ally’s gamble  on ‘lottery king’ Santiago Martin’s son-in-law backfires","description":"Despite suspending his party's deputy general secretary Aadhav Arjuna, VCK chief Thirumavalavan braces for turbulence in the ruling alliance","urlToImage":"https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/12/dmk-south.jpg?w=640","content":"Tamil Nadu’s tallest Dalit leader Thol Thirumavalavan – the chief of the Viduthalai Chiruthaigal Katchi (VCK), a key ally of the ruling DMK – has faced multiple challenges in his remarkable political career, but this one seemed to be different. For this did not come from casteist or communal politics, but arose out of his own party. Aadhav Arjuna, the son-in-law of the controversial “lottery king” Santiago Martin, had risen in the VCK ranks rapidly despite triggering various controversies and taking aim at the DMK leadership. Even after several VCK leaders warned him against Arjuna, Thirumavalavan did not act. On Monday, Thirumavalavan suspended Arjuna from the VCK, stating that his activities had caused “severe harm to the party’s reputation and goodwill”. He also asserted his party’s commitment to discipline and unity amid growing “internal and external” pressures. Thirumavalavan was said to be losing his grip on his party in recent months. Arjuna joined the VCK in January 2024 and was soon appointed as the party’s deputy general secretary despite not being a Dalit face or a politician with an established track record. Many attributed his quick rise to his “money power”. Arjuna’s rise and fall comes at a crucial time of Tamil Dalit politics. In July, BSP leader Armstrong was murdered in Chennai, which highlighted gang rivalries but filmmaker and Dalit activist Pa Ranjith, at a protest rally over it, questioned the entire political spectrum, including the DMK, for “denying” Dalits adequate space despite the dominance of the Dravidian parties. Despite accounting for over 21% of the state’s population, Dalits hold few leadership positions in major parties. The fresh Dalit assertion seeks to underline that the social inclusion remains elusive in the state even as welfare schemes and reservation have empowered many belonging to the community. Amid this unfolding scenario, Thirumavalavan inducted Arjuna as a “gamble”, said a VCK insider. “Arjuna brought money and energy, but his ambitions remained unbridled. He was good at presentations and argued with data. He told Thiruma several times that he should grow beyond what he is, that he can also become deputy CM or even CM. All that may be good. But Arjuna, like a good business strategist, saw VCK as just a stepping stone for himself,” he charged. A senior AIADMK leader targeted Arjuna, saying that “Thiruma is taller than anyone in Tamil politics. He is one leader who worked hard and evolved over the years. He commands as much respect as Stalin or Edappadi K Palaniswami.” A DMK minister said, “Thirumavalavan made sure that he evolved over the years, abandoned his narrow Tamil Dalit identity to get accepted across the Indian political circle. He made friends everywhere. Probably the only setback or a crisis he faced in his career was in 2004, when he resigned his MLA position as the VCK left the DMK alliance. That was also a political gamble, but one born out of ideology. Unfortunately, this one (Arjuna case) was different.” After joining the VCK, Arjuna held several meetings in a bid to streamline the party, organised a conference of its booth agents besides holding conferences against caste discrimination and liquor consumption. “His promise to restructure the party, energise our base, induct non-Dalits into our cadre fold, and get electoral success were all interesting. We watched it with unease in the initial months,” said a VCK leader. “Thirumavalavan decided on his own to induct Arjuna and informed us later,” said another VCK leader. “There were warnings from DMK. They told us Arjuna was trouble. But Thiruma (as Thirumavalavan is called by his followers) ignored it.” According to DMK sources, Arjuna had been associated with the M K Stalin-led party since 2016 as a part of its brand strategy team linked to Prashanth Kishore. He sought the DMK’s tickets to contest the 2019 Lok Sabha polls and the 2021 Assembly polls, but was “not entertained” on both occasions. He was also also denied a Rajya Sabha seat nomination that he demanded later. “We made it clear to him that we cannot promote him politically unless he works in the party for at least few years. This forced him to go to VCK after 2022,” said a DMK insider. After his brand strategy firm “Voice of Commons” conducted various surveys for the VCK in 2022-2023 with the avowed objective to “strengthen the VCK’s brand”, Arjuna joined the party in early 2024, where he also sought a ticket to contest the Lok Sabha polls. “Thirumavalavan responded positively to his wish. VCK also asked DMK for an extra seat in the general category for him, but DMK said no. They pointed to unchanged seat allocations for all allies,” a VCK leader said. The DMK’s refusal upset Arjuna. “He thought VCK was the ladder to his dreams. When denied, he started speaking out against DMK, calling for proper power-sharing in CM Stalin’s Cabinet. He criticised Udhayanidhi Stalin becoming Deputy CM, calling him just a film actor. He welcomed AIADMK for a conference we planned. He was the first to tweet to praise Vijay’s maiden political rally (after the launch of his party) and his speech in which the film star attacked DMK. The cracks widened. But still, Thiruma was reluctant to take cognisance of troubles created by Arjuna,” a VCK leader said. What seemed to have sealed Arjuna’s fate in the VCK was his remarks made at a high-profile function held last Friday for the launch of a book, Ellarukumana Thalaivar Ambedkar (Ambedkar: A leader for all), in which he invited Vijay instead of CM Stalin, forcing his own leader Thirumavalavan to opt out of it. “I was informed about Arjuna’s planning for the book release event. Even as I decided to skip it, I told him to attend it as he worked behind the event for many months. I did ask him to be careful in his speech, but he didn’t (follow),” Thirumavalavan said Saturday. Sharing the stage with Vijay, who made fiery remarks against the DMK-led alliance, Arjuna also made a hard-hitting speech. He called the DMK dispensation a “monarch’s rule” and accused it of allegedly controlling the Tamil cinema through political power. Vijay alleged that Thirumavalavan stayed away from the event under the DMK’s pressure. Besides Arjuna’s speech, praising Vijay’s ideology and calling him a new leader of the poor, the event organised by his firm kept the spotlight on the actor-turned-politician. Vijay’s speech was broadcast with a “dramatic camera angle” usually reserved for superstars. “This embarrassment could have been avoided,” another VCK leader said. “Thiruma took him in, ignoring advice. DMK had warned us before the 2024 polls itself. They knew him. They told us not to trust him,” he said. For Thirumavalavan, the storm is far from over. The party remains tied to the DMK, its strongest ally. “But the cracks are showing. How Thirumavalavan handles this moment will define his legacy. For our leadership will not easily trust VCK in the next elections until they seal the alliance pact. Because this is no longer just about Arjuna. It’s about trust,” the DMK minister said.","category":"politics"},{"publishedAt":"2024-12-11","title":"S M Krishna’s journey, from ‘Texas Gowda’ to ‘Singapore Bangalore’, hailed CM to halting politician","description":"One of the first leaders to realise the power of PR, Krishna built a largely well-deserved image of the man who put Bangalore on the global map. In the process though, he lost his bearing on the ground","urlToImage":"https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/12/S-M-Krishna.jpg?w=640","content":"Among his largely pastoral Vokkaliga community in South Karnataka, S M Krishna, who passed away early Tuesday at the age of 92, was once known as ‘Texas Gowda’. It was as much his higher education in the US — law degrees from Southern Methodist University, Dallas, Texas, and George Washington University in Washington in the 1950s, his Fulbright scholarship — as his suave, urbane ways that set Krishna apart, though he would go on to hold the highest position in Karnataka as Chief Minister, and serve as the Union External Affairs Minister in the twilight of his political career. Belonging to an affluent family, Krishna got into politics in 1962, almost as soon as he got back from the US. Success came early, with Krishna winning as an Independent in the Assembly elections from his hometown of Maddur in the Vokkaliga heartland district of Mandya. Later, he joined the Praja Socialist Party, an anti-Congress outfit, which reconciled with the Congress in 1968. He went on to win from the Mandya Lok Sabha seat thrice, in 1968, 1971 and 1980. But it was when he took over as the CM of Karnataka in 1999, holding the post till 2004, that Krishna’s golden period began. He was widely credited with putting the city of Bengaluru on the global map. The image of poster boy of the nascent Information Technology industry at the turn of the century fit Krishna well, with the Congress leader seeing through several infrastructure projects to meet his oft-stated goal “to convert Bangalore into Singapore”. One of the drivers of this was his Bangalore Agenda Task Force. Family members of S M Krishna at his residence in Bengaluru on Tuesday. (Express Photo) One of the first CMs to extensively use public and media relations, Krishna also courted the image of this new-age leader, building close ties with the elite in Bengaluru. At the same time, he was known as an able administrator who commanded the respect of the bureaucracy and his ministers. On Tuesday, as condolences poured in, most of them dwelled on this part of Krishna’s political journey. “It was during his tenure as CM that Bengaluru came to be known as the ‘Silicon Valley of India’,” current Karnataka CM Siddaramaiah recalled, while adding that Krishna’s dream of making Bengaluru Singapore was yet to be realised. Karnataka’s then Urban Development Minister D K Shivakumar – who is now Deputy CM – and Krishna’s businessman son-in-law V G Siddhartha (who died in 2019), were power players who profited in a big way during Krishna’s tenure largely through smart land deals. Eventually though, it was this excessive focus on Bangalore that cost Krishna, with rural votes turning against him in Karnataka. In 2004, he called early elections, thinking he had done enough to win the state again, but the Congress suffered a blow. That wasn’t the only setback for Krishna for, beginning in the 1990s, he had also started losing his Mandya turf to rising Vokkaliga leader H D Deve Gowda. Krishna would never recover that ground. In his biography of Deve Gowda titled Furrows in a Field, journalist and author Sugata Srinivasaraju writes that the JD(S) leader and many others contributed to the growth of the IT industry, and “it is a travesty that S M Krishna… became the poster boy of the IT industry in the media”. He writes, Krishna “pulled off a successful public relations trick by engaging the IT elite in Bengaluru and also endeavoured to make them the city’s quasi bureaucracy”. The Bangalore Agenda Task Force also came under a cloud later, with allegations that it privileged elite interests. After he lost as CM in 2004, the UPA government at the Centre made Krishna the Governor of Maharashtra. In a surprise decision in 2009, he was moved from his gubernatorial role to the position of External Affairs Minister. However, in 2011, Krishna committed a faux pas on the global stage, reading out the wrong speech at the UN, strengthening his detractors’ claims that age had started showing for the 79-year-old. He soon found himself out of the MEA. By then, there was also talk of the global spread of his son-in-law’s business interests. In 2017, Krishna sprang another surprise, ending a nearly five-decade association with the Congress to join the BJP, in what was seen as an effort to shield his son-in-law, who had come under the radar of the Income Tax and Enforcement Directorate under the Narendra Modi-led BJP government at the Centre. However, if the BJP hoped Krishna would help it find a footing in southern Karnataka, that never materialised. Now, the BJP, ironically, is riding on the shoulders of the Deve Gowda-led JD(S) there. Security personnel keep vigil as people arrive to pay tribute to S M Krishna at his residence in Bengaluru. (Photo: PTI) Last year, Krishna announced his retirement from active politics. “I got to know of discussions about me not being seen much (publicly). We all should be aware of our age. At the age of 90, we cannot act as though we are in our 50s. Respecting that age factor, I’m gradually stepping aside from public life,” he said. Krishna’s lasting legacy will be being among the last politicians of a certain kind in Karnataka, a charmer with both genders, who could often be found on a tennis court. He made it a ritual to travel for Wimbledon every year, and was a lifetime president of the Karnataka State Lawn Tennis Association The flip side, for many, is the other part of his legacy, being a father figure to Shivakumar, and the kind of politics the Congress Vokkaliga strongman, among Karnataka’s wealthiest leaders, represents. In his condolence message Tuesday, an emotional Shivakumar said: “S M Krishna was like my father. His guidance and advice are evident in my life. He is the architect of the new Karnataka.” Incidentally, as condolences poured in from the leadership of his old party (the Congress) and new (the BJP), Deve Gowda perhaps captured this dichotomy the best in his message Tuesday. “I am saddened by the passing away of Shri. S M Krishna, my friend and longtime Karnataka colleague… We started out in politics around the same time, and cultivated very different approaches to development and governance,” Deve Gowda, 91, said.","category":"politics"},{"publishedAt":"2024-12-11","title":"A bank election under Central forces cover: Bengal’s Mamata-Suvendu rivalry finds fertile Nandigram ground","description":"Clashes reported already and at least one death, as Supreme Court sends in Central forces for an election involving 430 candidates, 108 posts in Contai Cooperative Bank","urlToImage":"https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/12/mamata-banerjee-Suvendu-Adhikari.jpg?w=640","content":"Written by Tanusree Bose, Contai, a town in West Bengal’s Purba Medinipur district which houses the residence of Leader of the Opposition (LoP) in the Assembly Suvendu Adhikari and is his family bastion, finds itself in unusual spotlight. On Monday, the Supreme Court ordered that elections for the Contai Cooperative Bank (CCB) be held under the supervision of Central forces instead of the state police. The directive came after Shankar Bera, the former chairman of the Erga municipality, a civic body within Contai, and one of the 430 candidates vying for the 108 posts in the CCB in the December 15 elections, moved the apex court claiming the ruling Trinamool Congress (TMC) has deliberately selected a few villages far from the town to rig the polls. “Citing that some polling booths were located in sensitive areas, we sought the elections be held in the town as they are being held to elect the governing body of an urban cooperative. But the Court instead directed the polls to be held under the supervision of Central forces,” Bera said. Initially, three locations were designated as polling booths but the locations were changed in view of the ongoing exams and the number was also increased to five. Adhikari had served as the chairman of the CCB till he was removed from the post in August 2021, following the TMC government’s decision to probe the operations of several cooperative banks where he had held a position in the governing body. Also Read | Suvendu hits back at Mamata’s accusation of ‘one party spreading fake videos of Bangladesh’, says she made ‘politically motivated statement’ In a relief for Adhikari, the Calcutta High Court on July 16, 2021, ruled that the CCB’s account books could be probed, but no special audit can be conducted without its permission. The TMC sees winning the CCB polls as another strike against Adhikari, a former Mamata Banerjee confidant turned foe and BJP leader. Besides, going back to 1947, the CCB is the largest urban cooperative bank in Eastern India, and has 16 branches. The Supreme Court order, which also directed authorities to install CCTV cameras in polling booths, came a day after a TMC worker was murdered during elections for the Tamluk Cooperative Agriculture and Rural Development Bank. This happened the same day as a clash erupted between supporters of the TMC and BJP at Kanchannagar Bidya Bhavan High School in Nandigram. The ruling party won the polls, winning 56 of the 69 seats of the development bank. Following the Supreme Court directive, allegations have been flowing thick and fast between the TMC and BJP. While the BJP has called it a confirmation that the Mamata Banerjee-led party was seen as trying to rig the polls, the TMC has called the apex court order a result of the BJP’s bid to disturb the law and order situation in the state, for fear of losing. “We welcome the Supreme Court order. The petitioner sought protection as no voter in Bengal has security. The ruling party resorts to rigging, be it panchayat polls or local body elections,” BJP MP from Kanthi Soumendu Adhikari, the brother of Suvendu Adhikari, said. BJP Rajya Sabha MP Shamik Bhattacharya said the TMC suffered from a ‘Suvendu Adhikari syndrome’. “We had challenged them to take the lead here, but they failed. It is a matter of shame for Bengal and its people that Central forces are being deployed even for cooperative elections,” he said.","category":"politics"},{"publishedAt":"2024-12-11","title":"Why gap between votes secured, seats won in Maharashtra not really a discrepancy","description":"One factor is that parties didn’t contest the same number of seats; another that winning margins are not consistent","urlToImage":"https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/12/mahayuti_9a0265.jpg?w=640","content":"As the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) tries to come to terms with its rout in the recent Maharashtra Assembly elections, it has questioned the EVMs – and it has questioned the “discrepancy” between votes received by different parties and the number of seats won by them. While the BJP-NCP-Shiv Sena Mahayuti alliance won 230 of the 288 seats in the state, the MVA – that was hopeful of a win after its good performance in the Lok Sabha polls months earlier – finished with just 48 (including 2 seats of the Samajwadi Party, which has since distanced itself from the MVA in Maharashtra). What have the two sides said on the issue? NCP (SP) chief Sharad Pawar, a veteran who is not given to careless talk, said Sunday that while his party secured 72 lakh-odd votes in the elections, it won only 10 seats. Ajit Pawar’s NCP, on the other hand, received around 58 lakh votes and won 41 seats, he said. Similarly, Sharad Pawar said, the Shiv Sena (UBT), an MVA ally, got about 80 lakh votes and won 20 seats, while the Shiv Sena led by Eknath Shinde got slightly fewer votes and still won 57 seats. Also Read | Maharashtra: No mismatch in VVPAT & EVM data, says poll panel The BJP hit back, pointing to voting data from previous elections. Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis posted: “In the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, BJP received 1,49,13,914 votes and won nine seats, while Congress received 96,41,856 votes and won 13 seats. Shiv Sena secured 73,77,674 votes and won seven seats, while NCP (SP) received 58,51,166 votes and won eight seats.” Similarly, Fadnavis said, “In the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, Congress received 87,92,237 votes and won only one seat, while the united NCP got 83,87,363 votes and still won four seats.” What does the data tell us about the Lok Sabha elections in the state? The Modi wave in 2014 and 2019 led to a substantial increase in the average winning margins of candidates in Maharashtra, not just of the BJP and its allies but also those against it, as anti-BJP votes rallied together. This was not the case in the recent Lok Sabha elections, where the MVA finished ahead of the Mahayuti, but its candidates won by significantly lower margins. For example, the average winning margin in the state’s 48 Lok Sabha seats this time stood at 1.09 lakh votes, compared to 1.82 lakh in 2019 and 1.87 lakh in 2014. Before the Modi era, the average winning margin was 77,898 votes in 2009. Even this time, the BJP had the more resounding victories, with its average victory margin in the nine seats it won standing at 1.60 lakh votes. The biggest margin, of 3.57 lakh votes, was Union minister Piyush Goyal’s, from Mumbai North. The lowest for the BJP was in Satara, where Udayanraje Bhosale won by 32,771 votes. The BJP contested 28 seats. BJP ally Shiv Sena also had an impressive average winning margin, of 1 lakh votes. Its top performer was Sena leader Eknath Shinde’s son Shrikant from Kalyan, who won by 2.09 lakh votes, while the lowest was Ravindra Waikar, who won by 48 votes from Mumbai North West. The Sena contested 15 seats, and won seven. The BJP’s other ally, Ajit Pawar-led NCP, won only one of the four seats it contested, with a margin of 82,784 votes. The Congress, which at 13 won the highest number of seats in Maharashtra in this year’s Lok Sabha elections, had a lower average winning margin than the BJP and Sena, at 90,432 votes. Its highest winning margin was in Chandrapur, at 2.60 lakh votes, and the lowest was in Dhule, at 3,831 votes. It contested 17 seats. The average winning margin for the Sena (UBT) was higher than the Congress, at 1.12 lakh votes, with its highest margin being 3.29 lakh votes in Osmanabad, and the lowest in Mumbai North East, being 29,861 votes. It contested 21 seats and won nine. The NCP (SP) had an average winning margin almost the same as the Congress’s, at 89,571 votes, with the best strike rate of all parties, winning eight of the 10 seats it contested. Its top performer was Supriya Sule from Baramati, who won by 1.58 lakh votes, while the lowest was in Beed, of 6,553 votes. This gap in the average winning margins of parties in the two coalitions resulted in what Fadnavis pointed out: higher votes even if fewer seats for the Mahayuti parties. What does the data tell us about the Assembly elections? In the Assembly elections, such was the Mahayuti’s dominance that 15 of its 230 MLAs won by over one lakh votes, while not one of the MVA’s 48 winning MLAs could claim the same. In the last Assembly elections, in 2019, there were only four such seats that saw this margin mark. Of the 15 candidates with 1-lakh winning margin this time, eight belong to the BJP, four to the NCP and three to the Shinde Sena. There were very few close contests. Only four seats were decided by a margin of less than 1,000 votes, with Mahayuti allies securing two of those, and the Congress winning one. Consequently, the average winning margin in these Assembly elections surged to 34,943 votes, from 28,922 in 2019 and 22,985 in 2014. The BJP, which contested 149 seats and won 132, had the highest average margin of 42,082 votes. The other two Mahayuti parties ranked next, with the NCP, which contested 59 seats and won 41, having an average winning margin of 39,025 votes, and the Shiv Sena, which contested 85 seats and won 57, winning by 32,412 votes on average. In the MVA, the NCP (SP) fared the best in terms of winning margins, contesting 86 seats and winning 10 by an average margin of 23,823 votes. The Sena (UBT)’s average winning margin, from 94 seats it contested with 20 victories, was 13,872 votes, while the Congress, which contested 101 seats and won 16, had the lowest average margin of 12,674 votes. While the fact that the NCP (SP) had smaller winning margins but still ended up with 14 lakh more votes than the NCP may seem surprising, it is less so when considered that the Sharad Pawar-led faction contested 27 constituencies more than the group led by Ajit Pawar. Also Read | Maharashtra: Fadnavis unveils 100-day plan to revamp state administration Pawar’s other contention of few votes separating the two Senas, but Eknath Shinde-led faction ending up with 37 seats more than the Uddhav Thackeray-led one seems a combination of two factors. While the Uddhav Sena contested nine more seats, hence accounting for more votes, the Shinde Sena won its constituencies on average with two-and-a-half times more votes. 2024 Lok Sabha average winning margins: Mahayuti BJP: 9 seats, 1.60 lakh votes Shiv Sena: 7 seats, 1 lakh votes NCP: 1 seat, 82,784 votes Maha Vikas Aghadi Congress: 13 seats, 90,432 votes Sena (UBT): 9 seats, 1.12 lakh votes NCP (SP): 8 seats, 89.571 votes 2024 Assembly polls winning margins: Mahayuti BJP: 132 seats, 42,082 votes Shiv Sena: 57 seats, 32,412 votes NCP: 41 seats, 39,025 votes Maha Vikas Aghadi Congress: 16 seats, 12,674 votes Sena (UBT): 20 seats, 13,872 votes NCP (SP): 10 seats, 23,823 votes","category":"politics"},{"publishedAt":"2024-12-11","title":"Today in Politics: Maharashtra Cabinet expansion likely; SC to hear Manish Sisodia’s plea seeking relaxation of bail conditions","description":"Tussle for Maharashtra ministries continues between allies BJP and Shiv Sena led by Eknath Shinde; PM Modi to interact with young innovators at Smart India Hackathon-2024","urlToImage":"https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/12/ch1894417.jpg?w=640","content":"The Supreme Court on Monday said it would hear AAP leader Manish Sisodia’s pleas seeking relaxation of bail conditions which require him to report to the investigating officer twice a week in the corruption and money laundering cases related to the Delhi excise policy on Wednesday.

According to highly placed sources in the Mahayuti, the power-sharing between the alliance partners has been finalised: the BJP will keep 20 ministerial posts; Shiv Sena will get 12 berths; and the NCP 10. Devendra Fadnavis had taken oath as the Chief Minister, along with Sena leader Eknath Shinde and NCP chief Ajit Pawar as Deputy CMs on December 5. Fadanvis had then told mediapersons that the Cabinet expansion will take place before the Winter Session of the Assembly which commences in Nagpur on December 16. In terms of portfolios, the three parties are likely to veer towards maintaining the status quo, that is retain the top portfolios they held before the elections, with minor changes in the other portfolios. While Fadnavis will retain Home, the Finance Ministry will once again go to Ajit Pawar. Shinde is set to get the Urban Development Ministry which he held during his tenure as CM. After Shinde agreed for the Deputy CM post, the Sena had demanded that the party should get the Home portfolio. However, the BJP had made it clear that he would have to make the choice between Home and Urban Development. Sources in the Mahayuti indicated that while the Sena had got one portfolio less than what it wanted, the NCP’s demand was for 10 departments, which it has got. Insiders say the BJP held strong given that it far outnumbers its partners – with 132 MLAs, compared to the Sena’s 57 and NCP’s 41. So, the BJP is likely to retain Home, Housing, Revenue, General Administration Department, Law and Judiciary, Rural Development, Power, Water Resources, Tribal Welfare, OBC, and Higher and Technical Education. The key portfolios in the Sena’s bucket includes Urban Development, School Education, Health, Industries and Public Works Department. The NCP will have in its fold Finance, Cooperation, Agriculture, Food and Drugs administration, and Women and Child Welfare. While the final list of candidates shortlisted for the ministerial posts will require the Central leadership’s nod, caste, community and regional balance will be a top consideration. A senior NCP leader said, “In the first meeting itself, the party’s top leadership had categorically conveyed to the BJP that there can be some give and take on the number of Cabinet berths. But the party has no problem in maintaining the status quo, when it comes to portfolios.” Insiders said the Sena is driving a hard bargain for additionally the post of chairperson of the state Legislative Council. However, a sizeable section within the BJP believes that being the party with the most seats, it should not compromise on key constitutional posts including that of Legislative Council chairperson.","category":"politics"},{"publishedAt":"2024-12-11","title":"How BJP disrupted Lok Sabha on a day Opposition moved to remove V-P Dhankhar","description":"While Congress protests outside the House on the Adani issue, proceedings inside get derailed after the ruling party targets the Opposition party over its leadership’s alleged links to George Soros.","urlToImage":"https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/12/parliament-3.jpg?w=640","content":"Parliament continued to face disruptions on Tuesday as proceedings were abruptly adjourned for the fourth straight day. While Congress MPs led by the Leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha, Rahul Gandhi, continued to hold demonstrations against the bribery allegations against industrialist Gautam Adani, inside the Lok Sabha the Treasury benches protested against the alleged ties between billionaire investor George Soros and the Congress leadership. This happened on a day when the Opposition INDIA bloc submitted a notice for bringing a resolution to remove Vice-President Jagdeep Dhankhar from office, the first such move in Indian parliamentary history. On Parliament premises, Congress MPs carried black jholas (bags) with caricatures of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Adani printed on them along with the slogan “Modi, Adani bhai bhai (Modi, Adani are brothers)”. Apart from Gandhi, those present at the protest were Congress general secretary and Wayanad MP Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, other party MPs, and members from allies DMK, Jharkhand Mukti Morcha, and the Left. In the Lower House of Parliament, the ruling side protested against the alleged links between Soros and the Congress high command. The BJP raised the matter in both Houses on Thursday, leading to disruptions on Friday and Monday. The party has targeted Congress Parliamentary Party chairperson Sonia Gandhi. Here is what unfolded in the Lok Sabha: 11 am: As the House meets, BJP MPs stand up to protest on the Soros issue. Speaker Om Birla urges MPs to let the House run even as he takes exception to the Congress’s protest outside the House, saying it violates the rules and procedures and is an “undignified demonstration”. As he mentions the “role of top leaders of the Opposition” in the protest, the Treasury benches begin to shout “shame”. This provokes the Opposition and the Speaker is forced to adjourn the proceedings at 11.04 am.

Speaking to The Indian Express, parties such as the Biju Janata Dal (BJD), YSR Congress Party (YSRCP), and Bharat Rashtra Samithi (BRS) remained non-committal about their stand on the motion if the notice is accepted and the motion is moved. The BRS said it would discuss the matter with the leadership if someone from the INDIA bloc approached it. The INDIA bloc has 85 MPs in the Rajya Sabha, way short of the current halfway mark of 116. The alliance can additionally count on the support of Independent MP Kapil Sibal. The NDA, in contrast, has 113 MPs and can count on the support of six nominated members, who usually cast their vote with the government, and two Independents. The YSRCP, BJD, and BRS together have 19 MPs, Former Odisha CM and BJD president Naveen Patnaik, whose party has 7 MPs in the Rajya Sabha, did not clarify if the BJD would support the motion if it was brought to the House. ”We are examining it. We will take whatever step is necessary,” the BJD president told reporters in Bhubaneswar. BJD leader Sasmit Patra said, “This (no-trust motion) is an INDIA-led initiative. The BJD is not an INDIA party. Therefore, it doesn’t refer to us”. Asked if the party shares the same concerns about Dhankhar as the Opposition alliance, Patra said, “This concern has been brought up by INDIA parties. We are not party to it.” YSRCP, which has 8 MPs in the Upper House of Parliament, said it would not like to get “involved” in this. “We maintain a cordial relationship with the Chairman,” said YSRCP MP Mithun Reddy. The BRS said the party had attempted to bring both the Opposition and the ruling alliance on the same page. “We tried to help the Chairperson in bringing both the sides on the same page so that the House can run. As far as impeachment is concerned, we have not been approached by any party to sign any petition. Neither were we informed formally or informally (about the moving of this motion),” said BRS Rajya Sabha floor leader K R Suresh Reddy. Asked whether the BRS considers Dhankar impartial, he said, “Running the House is definitely not an easy task. We understand the Chairman’s predicament but, at the same time, we also felt that there should have been more meetings with all the warring groups, facilitated by the government. This would have brought the temperatures down.” The BRS, however, did not rule out joining the motion. “If someone (from INDIA) approaches us we will put it up for discussion in the party and seek the advice of our leader K Chandrashekar Rao,” said Reddy.","category":"politics"},{"publishedAt":"2024-12-11","title":"MPs want Allahabad HC judge impeached.

While more than half-a-dozen MPs, including AIMIM president Asaduddin Owaisi, SP MPs Zia-Ur- Rehman and Mohibbullah, Sudama Prasad of the CPI(ML)(L) and Rajkumar Roat of Rajasthan’s Bharat Adivasi Party (BAP), have signed the notice, signatures of at least 100 members are needed for the motion to be moved in the Lok Sabha. The minimum limit for the Rajya Sabha is 50 MPs. A look at how previous such impeachment motions against judges have fared: 2018 Opposition parties, including the Congress, moved a notice for impeaching then Chief Justice of India Dipak Misra for alleged “misbehaviour” and “misusing” his authority. The parties submitted their notice to then Rajya Sabha Chairman M Venkaiah Naidu, with the signature of 64 MPs. However, Naidu rejected the motion, saying the allegations were neither tenable or admissible. 2015 Fifty-eight MPs of the Rajya Sabha gave notice to the Chairman for a motion to remove Justice S K Gangele, a judge of the Madhya Pradesh High Court, over the alleged sexual harassment of a woman Additional District and Sessions Judge of Gwalior, “for not submitting to his illegal and immoral demands” and “misusing his position as the Administrative Judge of the High Court of Madhya Pradesh to use the subordinate judiciary to victimize the said Additional District and Sessions Judge”. The Judges Inquiry Committee formed to look into the charges by the Rajya Sabha acquitted Justice Gangele. “The allegation that the respondent judge was misusing his position by using the subordinate judiciary to victimize the complainant in discharge of her duties as judicial officer is not proved,” the report said. 2015 Fifty-eight Rajya Sabha MPs moved an impeachment notice against Justice J B Pardiwala of the Gujarat High Court for his “objectionable remarks on the issue of reservation”, in a case pertaining to then Patidar quota activist Hardik Patel. Hours after the MPs petitioned then-Rajya Sabha Chairman Hamid Ansari, Justice Pardiwala expunged those words from the judgment in question. 2011 Justice Soumitra Sen of the Calcutta High Court faced impeachment over allegedly appropriating Rs 32 lakh as a court-appointed receiver in a case. After the Rajya Sabha passed the motion for his removal in August 2011, the Lok Sabha was scheduled to discuss the motion in September. Before that could happen, Justice Sen resigned. 2009 Seventy-five Rajya Sabha MPs moved an impeachment motion against then-Karnataka High Court Chief Justice P D Dinakaran for possessing wealth disproportionate to known sources of income, among other charges. An inquiry committee continued probing the charges, and in 2011, Justice Dinakaran resigned, expressing lack of confidence in the probe. 1993 Supreme Court Justice V Ramaswami became the first judge to face impeachment motion in independent India’s history, when a motion on it was moved in the Lok Sabha in May 1993. He was alleged to have made lavish expenditures on his official residence while he was the Chief Justice of the Punjab and Haryana High Court. The motion was discussed in the Lok Sabha, with Congress leader Kapil Sibal representing Ramaswami in his capacity as a lawyer. The motion eventually fell through as less than the required two-thirds of total members present and voting supported it. Out of the 401 members present, 196 voted in favour and 205 Congress and other party MPs abstained.","category":"politics"},{"publishedAt":"2024-12-11","title":"Stripped of Indian citizenship, ex-BRS MLA close to KCR: Who is Chennamaneni Ramesh","description":"Telangana HC upheld Centre's order revoking Ramesh’s Indian citizenship on the ground of his German citizenship, slapping him with Rs 30 lakh fine for misleading the court","urlToImage":"https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/12/hyderabad-pulse.jpg?w=640","content":"Bharat Rashtra Samithi (BRS) leader, four-time MLA from Vemulawada, scion of an illustrious political family and a close aide of BRS chief and ex-Telangana chief minister K Chandrashekar Rao, Dr Chennamaneni Ramesh was dealt a blow on Monday after the Telangana High Court upheld the Centre’s order revoking his Indian citizenship and fined him Rs 30 lakh for misleading the court.

After returning to India briefly, he migrated to Germany in 1993, married a German citizen and gave up his Indian citizenship. His citizenship troubles began in 2009, during his first term as MLA, after then Congress candidate and current MLA Srinivas alleged that his rival had submitted false citizenship documents in his nomination papers and approached the (then Andhra Pradesh) High Court. The court on August 13, 2013 ruled that Ramesh held dual citizenship and thus was ineligible to contest polls. Ramesh challenged the decision in the Supreme Court, which stayed the High Court’s decision on August 11, 2016 while directing the Union Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) to take a decision on the issue. The MHA, in September 2017, cancelled Ramesh’s Indian citizenship citing his German citizenship. Two years later, he challenged the order in the Telangana High Court, contending that the Centre’s order had violated Section 10(3) of the Citizenship Act, 1955 and that the cancellation of his citizenship was unconstitutional. Ramesh had then told The Indian Express that he had returned to India in 2009 and had applied for citizenship, which was granted to him on February 3, 2009. However, Srinivas has been filing counter petitions and targeting Ramesh over the issue. Ramesh claimed his calling was in Germany but his family roots made it a natural choice for him to enter politics. His father C Rajeshwar Rao was a five-time MLA from Sircilla and a tall Communist leader who participated in the Quit India movement and the uprising against the Nizam’s rule. He later joined the Telugu Desam Party (TDP). His uncle is BJP leader and former Union Minister of State, C Vidyasagar Rao, who went on to serve as Governor of Maharashtra between 2014 and 2019. Ramesh’s electoral debut came after his father, who had successfully contested on a TDP ticket in 2004 from Sircilla, opted out and managed to secure a nomination from the party for his son from Vemulawada. “Ramesh quickly gained popularity in the constituency with his good work and outreach to people,” former BRS MLA Narsimha Rao said. The former Vemulawada MLA later quit the TDP and joined the BRS (then TRS) in support of the Telangana statehood movement even as his stellar academic background helped him grow close to party supremo K Chandrashekar Rao or KCR. Despite retaining the Vemulawada seat in 2014 and 2018, Ramesh was overlooked by the BRS for the November 2023 Assembly polls owing to his citizenship troubles. His tenure as advisor to the BRS government on agriculture affairs, with a Cabinet rank, also lasted only three months (from August to November 2023) as the BRS lost power to the Congress.","category":"politics"},{"publishedAt":"2024-12-11","title":"Jagdeep Dhankhar: A Rajya Sabha Chairman at daggers drawn with Opposition","description":"He first grabbed limelight for his frequent run-ins with Bengal government as the Governor, as Vice-President started off on a stormy note by criticising Supreme Court over NJAC judgment.","urlToImage":"https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/12/himkaara-booth-9.jpg?w=640","content":"Jagdeep Dhankhar is no stranger to disagreements with the Opposition. On Tuesday, the Vice-President became the first person holding one of the top two constitutional posts to face the prospect of impeachment as the Opposition submitted a notice to move a no-confidence motion against him, a first in Indian parliamentary history. The motion, if introduced, will require the support of a majority of all the members of the Upper House and needs to be agreed to by the Lok Sabha, according to Article 67(b). The motion is expected to be defeated as the Opposition does not have the numbers to push it through. The INDIA bloc has 85 members in the House, plus the support of Independent MP Kapil Sibal. Despite the numbers stacked against it, the Opposition wanted to send the message that it was not being allowed to speak in the House by the presiding officer. Dhankhar was elected Vice-President in August 2022 and his term as the Rajya Sabha Chairman began on a controversial note during the Winter Session that year as he called the Supreme Court’s 2015 judgment striking down the National Judicial Appointments Commission (NJAC) Act a “glaring instance” of “severe compromise” of parliamentary sovereignty and disregard of the “mandate of the people”. Also Read | No-trust motion against V-P Dhankhar accuses him of speaking for govt, silencing Opposition Since then, there have been several instances when he and Opposition MPs have not seen eye to eye: In August 2023, Dhankhar told the Opposition that he “could not and would not” direct Prime Minister Narendra Modi to be present in the House as it was the PM’s prerogative like any other MP to come to Parliament. He made this statement as the Opposition benches continued to demand the PM’s presence in the Rajya Sabha to address them on the issue of violence in Manipur. The ties between the Rajya Sabha Chairman and the Opposition hit a low during the Winter Session last year when 146 MPs were suspended from both Houses of Parliament, mostly over their demand for Union Home Minister Amit Shah’s statement on a Parliament security breach, followed by a discussion on the matter. It was the highest-ever number of suspensions in a Parliament session. As the proceedings came to a halt, Dhankhar wrote to Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge, the Leader of the Opposition (LoP) in the House, about the “acrimony and disruptions”. Kharge replied saying that “he was firmly in favour of dialogue and discussion”. In his letter, Dhankhar highlighted that the latter’s “refusal to meet him to resolve the political stalemate” was “not in sync with parliamentary practices” and sought a meeting. Kharge had declined Dhankhar’s invitation and in a letter said that the mass suspension of MPs was “premeditated” and “weaponised” by the ruling party to sabotage parliamentary practices. This June, Dhankhar courted controversy after Kharge entered the Well of House during a protest against paper leaks, with Dhankhar saying this was the first time that a LoP had done such a thing and called it a “stain” on Parliament. Kharge responded by saying he was trying to grab the attention of the Chairman who was looking towards the Treasury benches. In July, Rajya Sabha MP Kapil Sibal questioned the manner in which the Upper House was being run by Dhankhar and claimed that in no country the presiding officer of a House “frequently interrupts” members during their speeches. The same month, Dhankhar said the RSS has “unimpeachable credentials” and Constitutional rights to contribute to the development of the nation. “RSS is an organisation which is a global think tank of the highest order…,” he said in the House while responding to a comment from Samajwadi Party MP Ramji Lal Suman that the government’s main criterion for appointments was if a person belongs to the RSS. In September, in an apparent reference to Lok Sabha LoP Rahul Gandhi, Dhankhar, without naming him, said nothing was more condemnable than someone holding a Constitutional post becoming “part of enemies of the nation”. Dhankhar was speaking at Parliament to the third batch of the Rajya Sabha internship programme. During his visit to the United States that week, Gandhi said “love, respect, and humility” were missing from Indian politics. Strained ties with Mamata Banerjee Before he was elected Vice-President, Dhankhar served as the Governor of West Bengal when he had several run-ins with the government of Mamata Banerjee and became a vocal critic of the state administration. From the law and order situation in the state and post-poll violence to corruption accusations, alleged lapses in bureaucracy and the appointment of vice-chancellors in state universities, Dhankhar never shied away from criticising the government, which accused him of sitting on important BIlls. The situation took a turn for the worse when the state government in 2022 replaced the Governor with the CM as chancellor of state universities. Also Read | Decode Politics: Plans for another no-trust motion against Jagdeep Dhankhar: Why it is a new low in House ties His relationship with Mamata Banerjee became so acrimonious that the CM even blocked Dhankhar on social media. His relationship with Speaker Biman Banerjee was no less bitter, with the Speaker in 2021 complaining to then President Ram Nath Kovind about Dhankhar allegedly interfering in matters of the government. Dhankhar’s political journey Born into a farmer’s family at Kithana village in Jhunjhunu district in 1951, Dhankhar studied at a local government school before going to Sainik school in Chittorgarh. He studied law at the University of Rajasthan and became a professional lawyer, going on to serve as the president of the Rajasthan High Court Bar Association. Dhankhar started his political journey with the Janata Dal and in 1989, he was elected to the Lok Sabha from Jhunjhunu. After that, he moved to state politics and was elected to the Rajasthan Assembly in 1993 from Kishangarh on a Congress ticket. He again tried his luck in the Lok Sabha elections in 1998 but lost from Jhunjhunu. Starting that year, Dhankhar served as a full-time senior advocate in the Supreme Court and in 2003 switched to the BJP. He advised the party on important legal matters.","category":"politics"},{"publishedAt":"2024-12-11","title":"No-trust motion against V-P Dhankhar accuses him of speaking for govt, silencing Opposition","description":"The two-page document reportedly says the Rajya Sabha Chairman is extremely partisan, constantly interrupts Opposition members when they attempt to speak, repeatedly makes disparaging comments about them publicly.","urlToImage":"https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/12/himkaara-booth-6.jpg?w=640","content":"The notice given by Opposition INDIA bloc MPs Tuesday to bring a no-confidence motion against Vice-President Jagdeep Dhankhar is learnt to accuse him of “partisan” conduct in the Rajya Sabha, recounting some statements made by him allegedly against the Opposition, and says that he has taken it upon himself to be an “impassioned spokesperson” of the government’s policies at public fora. Sources privy to the notice said the two-page document also mentions Dhankhar’s July 2 remarks in the Rajya Sabha that he became “the Eklavya of the RSS” some 25 years ago, adding that this is “unbecoming” of the non-partisan nature of the presiding officer position he occupies in the House. The notice, it is learnt, goes on to call Dhankhar “explicitly partisan”, conducting the proceedings of the Rajya Sabha in “an extremely biased manner”. Sources said the Opposition has also alleged that Dhankhar constantly interrupts Opposition members when they attempt to speak, repeatedly makes disparaging comments about them publicly, and criticises them for expressing issues with the functioning of the government. The Opposition has reportedly attached newspaper clippings to make its case. The Opposition notice specifically mentions the events of Monday, December 9, in the House, when Dhankhar is said to have called some NDA MPs to speak even after rejecting their Rule 267 notice seeking to raise the issue of “rising threats to national security due to alleged nexus between a political party and some organisations working against India”. Also Read | Decode Politics | Plans for another no-trust motion against Jagdeep Dhankhar: Why it is a new low in House ties The Opposition notice is learnt to also accuse Dhankhar of unfairly using privilege motions to silence Opposition MPs, and of disparaging expression of dissent against the government. In this regard, the petition apparently makes these charges against Dhankhar – that he has denied “legitimate” requests of the Leader of the Opposition to challenge alleged falsehoods of the Prime Minister and Leader of the House; made unacceptable remarks against the Leader of the Opposition; criticised statements by Opposition leaders who are not even Rajya Sabha MPs; and publicly attacked Opposition MPs over views contrary to the position of the government. Thus, the petition argues, Dhankhar has reduced the “pivotal” role he has as the Chairperson of the Rajya Sabha to that of a mere spokesman for the government of the day.","category":"politics"},{"publishedAt":"2024-12-11","title":"From the Urdu Press: ‘If current INDIA leadership can’t fight BJP, consider an alternative’, ‘Foremost hope from Fadnavis govt is it will ensure amity’","description":"“India is still a rural country. Farmers are the nation’s anna daata, but their plight remains abysmal,” writes Urdu Times","urlToImage":"https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/12/mamata-pulse-1.jpg?w=640","content":"TMC chief and West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee’s statement expressing her willingness to lead the INDIA bloc if given a chance reflects the churn in the Opposition alliance, set off by the debacles faced by the Congress and some allies in the Haryana and Maharashtra polls. Several INDIA leaders have backed Mamata’s bid to steer the bloc. The Urdu dailies tracked the shifting sands in Opposition politics closely over the week. Besides focusing on the flare-up in the farm stir, the dailies also kept the spotlight on the developments over multiple suits filed in several courts in different places claiming Hindu rights over various Muslim mosques or sites. SIASAT Commenting on the rumblings in the INDIA bloc, the Hyderabad-based Siasat, in its leader on December 8, points out that unease seems to be growing in the Opposition alliance which was formed to take on the BJP in the Lok Sabha elections. The grouping could not clinch the Lok Sabha polls but managed to stall the BJP well below the simple majority mark. However, the editorial says, the Congress’s shock defeat in the Haryana Assembly elections followed by the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA)’s rout in the Maharashtra polls have dampened the INDIA parties’ morale. Although the Congress has blamed alleged electoral malpractices for these disasters, its leaders and workers are disappointed and worried, which has also led to the INDIA parties working at cross-purposes, the edit says. In Maharashtra, the Samajwadi Party (SP) has walked out of the MVA after Shiv Sena (UBT) chief Uddhav Thackeray’s close aide Milind Narwekar posted an image on X hailing the demolition of Babri Masjid, the daily notes. “The SP is aware of the significance of the Muslim vote in UP and does not want to lose it. The party achieved success in the Lok Sabha polls in UP because of the backing of Muslims among other communities,“ it says. “Babri Masjid still has resonance among the minority community even though the row has been legally resolved in the wake of the Supreme Court’s judgment and the construction of Ram Temple at its site in Ayodhya.” While the SP’s move has not affected the INDIA bloc at the national level so far, it has fuelled disquiet in the Opposition camp, the editorial says. This is being seen in Delhi too, where AAP chief Arvind Kejriwal is set to go solo without having any seat-sharing pact with the Congress in the upcoming Assembly polls. The issue of the INDIA bloc’s leadership, which is virtually with the Congress, has now also surfaced after TMC supremo Mamata Banerjee’s open pitch for it to ensure its smooth functioning. “Although other INDIA parties have not taken a clear stand on this issue so far, it is evident that several of them are deeply concerned over the future of the alliance. It is imperative that they should get into a huddle and discuss the situation,” the edit says. “They should deliberate on how to turn their defeats into successes. They must work out an effective action plan to fight the BJP. If it is not possible under the current leadership, they should replace it with a suitable alternative. The essential thing is that they must remain united if they want to take on the BJP. Unity is in their self-interest, even as it is also their political compulsion to remain afloat.” INQUILAB With BJP leader Devendra Fadnavis taking oath of office as the Chief Minister of Maharashtra and Shiv Sena chief Eknath Shinde and NCP president Ajit Pawar sworn in as the Deputy CMs, the New Delhi edition of Inquilab, in its December 8 editorial, notes that despite registering a resounding win to storm back to power, the BJP-led Mahayuti took 12 days to form its government. This indicated “pulls and pressures” within the ruling coalition, with ex-CM Shinde remaining upset until the eleventh hour after being denied the CM’s post by the BJP. “The episode also betrayed the BJP’s coalition compulsion as given its tally the party is within striking distance of mustering a majority on its own, but it could not have moved ahead unilaterally to form the government,” the editorial says. Ajit, who was the first to pledge support to the Fadnavis-led government, has been sitting pretty though, the daily says. “It is to be seen how the Mahayuti government functions. The BJP had earlier faced allegations of causing splits in both the Sena and the NCP.” The editorial says this will also be closely watched as to how Uddhav Thackeray and Sharad Pawar lead their respective parties, Shiv Sena (UBT) and NCP(SP), now. Uddhav and Pawar have their task cut out after the drubbing their parties got in the Assembly polls, although Shinde and Ajit also face stiff challenges, the edit states. Also Read | Congress woes grow as Lalu backs Mamata on INDIA bloc leadership: ‘Let her take it … doesn’t matter if Congress objects’ “The foremost expectation from the new Fadnavis regime, which is another ‘double-engine government’ is that it give priority to ensuring communal harmony in the state. Despite claiming accomplishments on the development front, the BJP banked on divisive slogans like ‘katenge toh batenge’ in its campaign. With polls now out of the way, the party should turn over a new leaf,” the daily says. Besides several ongoing infrastructure projects, which should be completed on time, the Mahayuti needs to enhance the monthly financial assistance for underprivileged women under the Ladki Bahin Yojana as per its poll pledge. “Maharashtra has been beset with the problems of unemployment and price rise, although it has always been known as a leading state in creating jobs. The new government must take measures to address these burning issues,” the edit adds. URDU TIMES Referring to the resurgence of farmers’ “Delhi Chalo” protest over their demands, the Mumbai-based Urdu Times, in its December 7 editorial, points out that the demands of the agitating farmers have been the same for the past several years. The members of the Kisan Mazdoor Morcha (KMM) and Sanyukt Kisan Morcha (Non-Political) have been agitating at Shambhu and Khanauri on the Punjab-Haryana border for over 300 days, demanding legal guarantee for the Minimum Support Price (MSP) for their crops and a loan waiver among others. The editorial points out that the protesting farmers have been forced to march to Delhi as the Centre has not reached out to them and addressed their demands. “Haryana police cracked down on the farm protesters to stop them from entering the state en route to Delhi. Although in order to dial down tension the farmers decided to march to the national capital on foot, but the administration has not accepted even this,” it says. The daily points out that the farm row has been raging since 2020, when farmers launched their year-long agitation against the Centre’s three contentious agricultural laws. Although the Narendra Modi government was eventually forced to repeal these three laws, it has still not met their demand for ensuring a statutory basis for the MSP, it says, adding that the government’s promise to double the farmers’ income has not been fulfilled yet. “India is still a rural country. Farmers are the nation’s anna daata, but their plight remains abysmal,” the edit says. A measure of the distress in the agriculture sector could be gauged from the point that over 11,000 farmers and agricultural labourers died by suicide in 2022 alone, it adds.","category":"politics"},{"publishedAt":"2024-12-11","title":"Congress woes grow as Lalu backs Mamata on INDIA bloc leadership: ‘Let her take it … doesn’t matter if Congress objects’","description":"NCP (SP) and SP have also indicated that Congress, especially Rahul Gandhi, may not be the presumptive leader of the bloc.","urlToImage":"https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/12/himkaara-booth-2.jpg?w=640","content":"The debate over leadership of the INDIA bloc, triggered by Trinamool Congress chief and West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, is sharply dividing the multi-party Opposition alliance. On Tuesday, veteran RJD leader and long-time Gandhi family supporter Lalu Prasad threw his weight behind Banerjee. Asked about Banerjee’s remarks that “I can run INDIA bloc… if they can’t run the show”, Lalu told reporters: “Theek hai, de dena chaahiye. Ham sahmat hain (It’s fine, she should be given the responsibility. We are in agreement).” On whether the Congress might object, Lalu said: “It doesn’t matter… Mamata ko de do (Give the responsibility to Mamata).” Lalu’s remarks follow NCP (SP) chief Sharad Pawar’s reaction to Banerjee’s claim, calling her a “capable leader”. “She is a capable leader… and has the right to say it. The MPs she has sent to Parliament are hardworking and aware,” Pawar was reported as saying. Also Read | Buffeted by debacles, INDIA bloc totters as Congress braces for winter of discontent On Monday, Samajwadi Party general secretary and Rajya Sabha MP Ram Gopal Yadav said that as of now, Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge was “the leader of the INDIA bloc”. He was replying to questions from reporters, in Saifai in Uttar Pradesh, whether he saw Rahul Gandhi as head of the bloc. At the same time, Yadav asserted, the SP wants the INDIA bloc “to prevail and contest elections together”. The SP’s differences with the Congress have been growing since the Lok Sabha results. The fact that its significant partners are speaking out against its presumptive leadership of the INDIA bloc, as the largest party in it, is not good news for the Congress. The high of the Lok Sabha results, where the INDIA bloc reduced the BJP to less than a majority and the Congress itself got 99 seats, has evaporated in the blast of the Congress’s stunning losses in the Haryana and Maharashtra Assembly elections, and its poor showing in Jammu and Kashmir. Also Read | From the Urdu Press: ‘If current INDIA leadership can’t fight BJP, consider an alternative’, ‘Foremost hope from Fadnavis govt is it will ensure amity’ If the Congress is the largest party in the bloc, the SP is the second-largest and the TMC the third. Of the other INDIA parties, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) has already announced that it would go alone in the Assembly elections for Delhi. Even if the AAP concedes, the Congress can at best hope to play second fiddle to it. Lalu’s endorsement of Banerjee could also be read as a message to the Congress ahead of the Bihar Assembly elections slated for next year. With the Congress slipping in Bihar as well, a confident RJD is not expected to part with many seats in the polls. In private, Congress leaders dismissed Banerjee’s statement as “posturing”, with little consequence. “The TMC has not been attending meetings of INDIA bloc floor leaders in Parliament. When we ask them, their leaders say the TMC is not in the INDIA bloc. And then Mamata says she is ready to lead the alliance… it is surprising,” a leader said. Congress leaders say that any decision on leadership will be taken collectively by the alliance, and any one party cannot take a view or make a comment on this. Yadav evaded answering a question on Banerjee’s claim to leadership of the INDIA bloc. The TMC chief may have said this as the Congress did not perform well in the Lok Sabha and the recent Assembly elections, the SP leader said. “The Congress is in power in Himachal Pradesh, (but) in the Lok Sabha elections, they lost all the four seats (in the state). The Congress is in power in Karnataka and Telangana… they lost half the seats (there)… They didn’t win a single Lok Sabha seat in Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh… So it is possible that there may be talk that there should be a leadership change. But I don’t want to get into it… The INDIA bloc is there, it should be there. Without an alliance, the BJP cannot be defeated.”","category":"politics"},{"publishedAt":"2024-12-11","title":"S M Krishna, a foreign minister whose record speaks louder than his gaffes","description":"A conversation with the old-school politician, who never showed any signs of a grudge over a damaging news report I did, almost always led to books -- invariably the latest on geopolitics","urlToImage":"https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/12/sm-krishna-hina-rabbani.jpg?w=640","content":"S M Krishna, the Minister of External Affairs between June 2009 and October 2012, was brought to the job in the second term of the UPA because of his wealth of experience. Krishna, credited with creating world-class infrastructure in Bengaluru during his stint as Karnataka Chief Minister, passed away on Tuesday at 92. “I got the call in 2009 from the PM (Manmohan Singh) when I was going out to play tennis. I was in Bangalore when it happened,” he told me later. However, he started his innings with a bumpy ride. After The Indian Express wrote about his stay at a five-star hotel for three months amid the Congress’s austerity drive, he, along with then MoS (External Affairs) Shashi Tharoor, was publicly asked to vacate the hotel by his predecessor and then Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee. Krishna was an old-school politician who did not hold any grudge and never brought this up in the years that I covered his office and the ministry. Over the years, I would meet him for stories and we would end up talking about books. I would find that he would invariably be reading the latest books on geopolitics. Former Karnataka CM S M Krishna with Kannada matinee idol Dr Rajkumar. (Express archive) His calm and composed style was something his officials and fellow foreign ministers would compliment him on as he navigated the foreign policy bureaucracy in active consultation with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. At 77, he was one of the oldest members of the Cabinet at that time — he made 83 overseas trips as India’s foreign minister till he hung up his boots at 80. As his age caught up with him, he made a gaffe many would later remember him for. At a United Nations meeting in 2011, Krishna read the speech of the Portuguese Foreign Minister for more than three minutes before Hardeep Singh Puri, the current Petroleum Minister and then India’s Permanent Representative at the UN in New York, interrupted him. Dialogue with Pakistan In the years after the Mumbai 26/11 attacks, Krishna took up the challenging task of engaging with Pakistan. After a false start in the India-Pakistan relationship — following a spat with the then foreign minister of Pakistan — the External Affairs Minister worked in tandem with the Prime Minister’s Office to resume the dialogue process between the two sides. As a result, the Foreign Secretaries of the two countries met in Thimphu, Bhutan, on the sidelines of SAARC and decided to start the dialogue on all outstanding issues. Krishna followed PM Singh’s brief in toto and developed a strong rapport with Pakistan Foreign Minister Hina Rabbani Khar. He travelled to Pakistan in September 2012 and met Shahbaz Sharif in Lahore apart from the top leadership in Islamabad. However, he was criticised for not defending Home Secretary G K Pillai in Islamabad at a joint press conference with Pakistan Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi when Pillai was equated with Lashkar-e-Toiba co-founder Hafiz Saeed. S M Krishna with Kannada actor-politician Ambareesh. (Express archive) As New Delhi ratcheted up its campaign for the UNSC non-permanent membership in 2010, Krishna worked the phones and spoke as well as met foreign ministers and interlocutors from more than 100 countries. In the end, India won the UNSC non-permanent seat as it got 187 out of 192 votes. Krishna engaged and met as many as 89 dignitaries in 2010-11 and the high point was the visit to India in 2010 by the heads of state or government of all the P-5 countries: US President Barack Obama, Russian President Vladimir Putin, Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao, French President Nicolas Sarkozy, and British PM David Cameron. It was a rare feat and the afterglow of the Indo-US nuclear deal and its impact on India’s global standing. Rapport with Hillary Clinton, Hina Rabbani Khar Krishna got along quite well with US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, with whom he co-chaired three rounds of the India-US strategic dialogue. He was also in constant touch with US officials and was key in getting Washington to agree to give access to David Coleman Headley, a terror suspect in the 26/11 case who is still in the US. Krishna also developed a strong rapport with his Iranian counterpart Manouchehr Mottaki and was able to see that India-Iran relations were not affected by India’s stance on Tehran’s nuclear programme. When Krishna quit, he mentioned Hina Rabbani Khar twice and talked fondly about his rapport with her. “I had a good understanding with Hina Rabbani Khar and (Chinese Foreign minister) Yang Jiechi,” Krishna said, also mentioning his personal equations with Brazil’s Foreign Minister Antonio de Aguiar Patriota and South Africa’s Maite Nkoana-Mashabane. In 2011, as the Arab spring swept through West Asia and North Africa, in Egypt and then in Libya, the MEA under his charge and in coordination with other ministries assisted Indians in getting out of those two countries. The Libya evacuation operation was billed as the largest one after Kuwait in 1991 as 16,000 Indian nationals were brought back home in special flights. As foreign minister, Krishna took up consular issues of Indians in distress overseas and sometimes made it his mission, often overlooking facts in his zeal. His high-decibel rhetoric on the incidents of violence against students in Australia — some racist, some were just isolated incidents — queered the India-Australia ties back then. Krishna also took up the case of an Indian couple in Norway for their child’s custody but it turned out to be one of marital discord. As someone who needed prompting during meetings and even while answering questions in Parliament, Krishna left a poor impression as a Cabinet minister holding the External Affairs Minister’s portfolio. Once he misunderstood a question about a Pakistani national lodged in an Indian jail and answered that he would take up the matter with the Pakistan government to ensure the prisoner’s release. A stunned Rajya Sabha had to remind him that the person concerned was in an Indian jail. A success and a graceful exit But despite his gaffes, if there was one thing that Krishna accomplished and used his IT expertise from his Bengaluru days was the implementation of the Passport Seva project that cut down the red tape in issuing passports and eased the number of documents and time. He outsourced it to the Tatas. The pilot project began in Bengaluru and was expanded to the entire country. This was a success story that successive foreign ministers and governments have built on. When Krishna was asked to step down in October 2012, he did so gracefully. At the time in his Thyagaraja Road residence, Krishna said that “senior citizens should make way” in ministerial positions in tune with the young demographic profile of the country. When I asked him if he would recommend an age limit for Union Cabinet ministers, Krishna laughed and said, “I can talk about myself, cannot talk about others.”","category":"politics"},{"publishedAt":"2024-12-11","title":"Pawan Kalyan’s brother Naga Babu to finally get his moment in the sun after long supporting role stint","description":"After long hours spent nursing brother Kalyan's political turf, Konidela Nagendra Babu set to be inducted as a minister in the Andhra Pradesh government","urlToImage":"https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/12/naga-babu-2.jpg?w=640","content":"Much like his movies where he often essays supporting roles, Konidela Nagendra Babu, also known as Naga Babu, has been a strong pillar of support for his brother, Andhra Pradesh Deputy Chief Minister and JanaSena Party (JSP) founder Pawan Kalyan. Babu, who is currently the national general secretary of the JSP, finally seems to have got his “reward”. Andhra Pradesh CM N Chandrababu Naidu announced on Monday that Naga Babu, 63, would be inducted into the state Cabinet as a minister. Consistently seen by Kalyan’s side since the actor launched his JSP in 2014, the road to the Cabinet has not been easy for Babu. Unlike his two brothers – Kalyan and Chiranjeevi – Babu did not rise to superstardom through his films. Electorally too, his debut ended in defeat. In his first election, the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, he finished third behind the YSR Congress Party (YSRCP) and Telugu Desam Party (TDP) candidates, while securing over 2.5 lakh votes. After his defeat and the JSP’s subsequent alliance with the TDP and BJP ahead of the 2024 simultaneous Lok Sabha and Assembly polls, he held the fort for Kalyan in his constituency, Pithapuram, while the JSP chief embarked on his statewide campaign. “Babu garu has been an integral part of the JSP since its inception. We are happy that he will finally get his due. He has firmly stood by Kalyan garu and has taken on his opponents head-on,” a close aide of Kalyan, who has been with the JSP since its inception, told The Indian Express. Also Read | His feet firmly grounded in Andhra, what was behind Pawan Kalyan’s power-packed Delhi trip The reference appeared to also be to the fact that Babu was let down during the recent Lok Sabha polls, when he did not get the expected ticket from the Anakapalle Lok Sabha seat. The constituency went to the BJP as a part of the seat-sharing agreement in the JSP-TDP-BJP alliance. Following the alliance’s massive victory, where it won 164 of the state’s 175 Assembly and 21 of the 25 Lok Sabha seats, buzz surrounding Babu’s elevation as the chairman of the Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams (TTD) Board had gained momentum. Eventually, reportedly due to the caste conundrum, the NDA government appointed B R Naidu to the post. Babu was also one of the favourites for a Rajya Sabha nomination after three YSRCP MPs resigned from the Upper House, necessitating bypolls. However, again, he was left out. A TDP leader said the party too wanted its own leaders in the Rajya Sabha. “We wanted two seats while we were ready to give one to either the BJP or the JSP. The BJP was keen on the seat and hence the JSP did not get it.” JSP sources said the party was prepared for such a scenario, and hence the contingency plan of ministership. “We were allotted four Cabinet berths when the NDA came to power in Andhra. However, only three ministers – Kalyan, Tenali MLA Nadendla Manohar and Nidadavole legislator Kandula Durgesh – took oath as ministers… With six MLC seats likely to be vacant soon… we will make Babu garu a minister through the MLC quota,” K Ranga Babu, the JSP’s Assembly coordinator of Pithapuram, told The Indian Express. Andhra can have 26 ministers and currently one post is vacant.","category":"politics"},{"publishedAt":"2024-12-11","title":"Sambhal to Jaunpur: How a surge in mosque rows is shaping UP politics ahead of 2027 polls","description":"The political ramifications in the wake of new petitions and the consequent polarisation may fuel Adityanth’s brand of Hindutva politics, which is seen by many to be more aggressive than the BJP's standard line","urlToImage":"https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/12/dec24-8.jpg?w=640","content":"The Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections are still more than two years away, but with multiple suits filed in several local courts claiming Hindu rights over various Muslim mosques or sites, the political landscape in the state has already started heating up. Three of such petitions have been filed in recent weeks in UP, while one, seeking a survey in Ajmer Sharif Dargah, has been filed in an Ajmer court in Rajasthan. On November 19, a plea was filed in a Chandausi court in UP, claiming Hindu right over the Shahi Jama Masjid in Sambhal. The court ordered a survey of the mosque the same day, with the administration undertaking it by the evening too. Violence erupted during the second survey of this Mughal-era mosque on November 24 in which at least four people were killed. Political Pulse | How Sambhal row was born, post 1878 suit dismissal, post 1976 tension, when a priest met some familiar names Since then, petitions filed in the courts making similar claims over Shamshi Shahi mosque in Badaun as well as Atala mosque in Jaunpur have seen significant developments. The Opposition has cried foul over the manner in which these petitions have been admitted by the lower courts besides the alacrity shown by the state administration in implementing their orders. Against this backdrop, the Supreme Court has now constituted a special bench to hear a clutch of pending petitions challenging the constitutional validity of the Places of Worship (Special Provisions) Act, 1991, which stipulates that the nature of all places of worship, except the one in Ayodhya that was then under litigation, shall be maintained as it was on August 15, 1947. Notably, petitions seeking Hindu rights over Gyanvapi mosque in Varanasi and Idgah mosque in Mathura were filed in 2021 – a year before the 2022 UP polls in which the Yogi Adityanath-led BJP returned to power for the second consecutive time, bagging 255 out of 403 seats as against the Samajwadi Party’s 111 seats. Don't Miss | Story of the 500-year-old Sambhal mosque: Competing histories, mythology, and legal fights The political ramifications in the wake of new petitions and the consequent polarisation may fuel Adityanth’s brand of Hindutva politics, which is seen by many to be more aggressive than the BJP’s standard line. The Gorakshnath Math in Gorakhpur, which Adityanath heads, had been closely associated with the Ayodhya movement which culminated in the construction of Ram Temple in January 2024 in the wake of the apex court’s 2019 judgment. In early 2025, UP’s Prayagraj will also host the Maha Kumbh, which is considered the biggest Hindu cultural event. The CM has already reached out to the RSS top brass to make the event an inclusive one where all castes and sects of the Hindu society could be represented. It has also been seen as Adityanath’s bid to boost his national profile as a Hindutva leader. In August this year, while addressing a public meeting in Agra, Adityanath had made the “batenge to katenge (divided, we fall)” remark while referring to anti-Hindu violence in Bangladesh. The slogan was used by the BJP in its campaign in the recent Maharashtra polls, which the party-led Mahayuti clinched by a landslide. It was even endorsed by RSS general secretary Dattatreya Hosabale. “Hindutva plus law and order, governance and welfare is the sum total of Maharaj ji (Adityanath)’s politics. But Hindutva is the base on which everything else is built upon. Also, the Opposition has demonstrated (in the 2024 Lok Sabha polls), at least in UP, that it is as good as the BJP in social engineering. The law and order achievements have been used successfully in the 2022 polls, even as the welfare politics has entered a competitive phase now.” a UP BJP leader said, adding that “At a time when the Opposition is bent on dividing the society on caste lines, we have to build up further on Hindutva.” Opinion | BJP needs to display compassion, not triumphalism Denying that the government had anything to do with the petitions, he also claimed: “They (petitioners) are all individuals neither connected with the BJP nor with the Sangh Parivar. The matters are all in courts. But if the other side creates trouble despite court orders, action is bound to be taken under the Yogi government.” The petitions have also evoked divergent responses from the parties of the Opposition INDIA bloc. The SP, the principal Opposition in UP, has blamed the state government for the deaths in Sambhal, accusing the BJP of “spreading hate”. SP chief Akhilesh Yadav has, however, not made any attempts to visit Sambhal so far. Only the SP’s Leader of Opposition (LoP) in the Assembly Mata Prasad Pandey made an attempt to visit the town with a delegation of party leaders on November 30, which was thwarted by the administration. Many see this as the SP’s move to tread cautiously on the issue in a bid to prevent the BJP from polarising the matter. Also in Political Pulse | UP Congress chief: ‘There is jungle raj in UP…To remove it, we decided to let SP contest bypolls…We will continue to be ‘big brother’ in the alliance’ On the other hand, the Congress has not only been vocal on the issue but party leaders Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi have even tried to visit Sambhal only to be stopped by UP police. Earlier this month, the Congress Working Committee reiterated its commitment to the Places of Worship Act in one of its resolutions passed at the meeting. The UP Congress’s minority wing has also launched a statewide campaign against alleged violation of this Act in the aftermath of the Sambhal petition. The campaign was kicked off on the anniversary of the Babri Masjid demolition on December 6, which also marks the death anniversary of B R Ambedkar, the architect of the Constitution. Some UP Congress leaders have even alleged that reopening of these disputes could extend to the issue of lands allotted to Dalits. The Congress has been attempting to reconsolidate its traditional vote bank of Muslims and Dalits, which was seen in the 2024 Lok Sabha polls, when it had accused the ruling BJP of trying to allegedly “change the Constitution”. The support from these sections would also put the grand old party in a better position to negotiate seat-sharing with its INDIA ally SP for the 2027 Assembly polls.","category":"politics"},{"publishedAt":"2024-12-11","title":"Why AAP chose Jangpura to field its second-in-command Manish Sisodia","description":"A ‘safe’ seat with a mixed Punjabi and Sikh population, it has been won by AAP past three times","urlToImage":"https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/12/manish-sisodia.jpg?w=640","content":"Two weeks ago, former Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia rushed to the jhuggi jhopri (JJ) cluster near Sundar Nursery in Jangpura late in the evening. Minutes after it became clear that BJP leaders were visiting unauthorised colonies and slum clusters as part of its Delhi Assembly election campaign, sitting MLA Praveen Kumar and Greater Kailash MLA Saurabh Bharadwaj also joined Sisodia. The leader sat in the midst of people whose houses had been razed in a demolition drive, some with documents in their hands to show they had lived in the area for decades. If there was an indication that Sisodia would pick a different constituency to contest from this time, the late-evening visit was the clearest one. On Monday, as AAP came out with its second list of candidates, the senior leader’s shift to Jangpura was confirmed. The constituency has traditionally been seen as a Sikh, Punjabi majority area. Keeping in mind the seat make-up, AAP had fielded Maninder Singh Dhir in its maiden election in 2013. He won and went on to become the Speaker of the Delhi Assembly. He, however, quit and joined the BJP ahead of the 2015 election. Political Pulse | As Manish Sisodia is shifted to Jangpura, how AAP is planning to beat anti-incumbency in Delhi AAP then turned to Praveen Deshmukh, better known as Praveen Kumar, who has been associated with AAP since its India Against Corruption days and led a team of volunteers from the area, a party insider said. He was also the one behind Dhir’s campaign in 2013. While Dhir got 37% of the vote share in 2013, Praveen improved the winning percentage to 48% in 2015 and 50% in 2020. On Monday, when Praveen was dropped from the list, he wrote in a post on X, “The father of the education revolution in Delhi, Manish Sisodia ji was kept in jail for 17 months by BJP’s puppet ED-CBI by implicating him in fake cases. This was not only an injustice but also a conspiracy to suppress the voice of the people. I told Manish ji that the people of Jangpura will answer this injustice. We will make him victorious by a large number of votes… I stand shoulder to shoulder with Manish ji in this fight.” The party views Jangpura as a “safe”seat and hopes that the Dalit and Muslim population in areas such as Nehru Nagar, Sunlight Colony, Nizamuddin Basti and Daryaganj will give Sisodia a comfortable win, who won in Patparganj in 2020 by a thin margin of just about 3,200 votes. “Jangpura has always been considered a safe seat. In 2020, it was also Atishi’s first choice before she was fielded from Kalkaji. The demographics are a mix of all classes in addition to having a sizable Sikh and Muslim population spread across (socio-economic) backgrounds. Additionally, the switch was necessary to make sure his electoral career does not hit a speed bump,” another party leader said. Sisodia wrote to party volunteers from Jangpura after his name was announced and sought their support. “This is not merely a responsibility to fight an election, but a commitment to ensure that every child in Jangpura receives quality education, every woman feels safe, every street and alley is clean, and every family has access to their basic needs — electricity, water, healthcare, and employment — without any hindrance. Since the AAP’s inception, Jangpura has been home to some of the most dedicated volunteers,” he said. Sisodia also spoke about his decision to leave Patparganj. Calling the constituency the birthplace of his political career, he said he left it because Avadh Ojha, who joined the party last week, had expressed a desire to contest from there.

I realised that I should respect his wish to begin his journey from there,” he wrote. The BJP, however, called Sisodia a “fugitive” and said the change in his seat reflects the disquiet in AAP ahead of the polls. The Congress said that Sisodia had to change his constituency because he was not able to address the problems of the people of Patparganj.","category":"politics"},{"publishedAt":"2024-12-11","title":"Today in Politics: Will INDIA bloc move no-confidence motion against Jagdeep Dhankhar in Rajya Sabha?","description":"Last day for nomination for bypolls to six Upper House seats","urlToImage":"https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/12/jagdeep-dhankhar.jpg?w=640","content":"All eyes will be on the Rajya Sabha on Tuesday after the INDIA bloc parties decided that they are likely to submit a motion to move a no-confidence against Upper house Chairman Jagdeep Dhankhar “very soon”. The Opposition parties do not have the numbers in the House to ensure Dhankhar’s impeachment as Vice President but are contemplating the move as a political signal. Sources said MPs of the Trinamool Congress (TMC) and the Samajwadi Party (SP) — parties that have not been attending the Congress-led protests outside Parliament on the Adani issue — have also signed the notice under Article 67(b) of the Constitution. This is the second such attempt by the Opposition parties this year. The resolution, however, should be moved with at least 14 days’ notice. The Winter Session of Parliament ends on December 20. According to 67(b), “a Vice-President may be removed from his office by a resolution of the Council of States passed by a majority of all the then members of the Council and agreed to by the House of the People; but no resolution for the purpose of this clause shall be moved unless at least fourteen days’ notice has been given of the intention to move the resolution.” A senior Opposition leader told The Indian Express, “Leave aside technicalities (like 14 days’ notice), leave aside the fact that we in the Opposition don’t have the numbers … a message has to go to the BJP they cannot ruin Parliament like this. We are fighting to save Parliament democracy,” Asked when the Opposition was planning to submit the notice, another senior leader said “very soon”. “This government is murdering Parliament,” said TMC’s Deputy Leader in the Rajya Sabha Sagarika Ghose. “They are scared because they do not have the answers to issues affecting common people. The BJP and the government are misusing high constitutional offices and making them subservient to executive power. The Opposition does not have the numbers in the Rajya Sabha, but this is a fight against all those who want to ruin our Parliamentary system. At stake is the integrity of our parliamentary democracy itself and the solemn constitutional rights of every representative of the people.” The INDIA bloc parties together have 103 members in the House plus the support of Independent MP Kapil Sibal. The Opposition parties, which have been accusing Dhankhar of partisanship for some time, have been mulling submitting a notice for bringing an impeachment resolution since the last session. They were also upset over Dhankhar naming Congress MP Abhishek Singhvi last week in the context of recovery of what he called a “wad of currency notes from the seat allotted to him. Sources in the Opposition bloc said the opportunity given by the Chair to some of the ruling party members to raise the issue of alleged Congress links with a forum that is said to have received funds from billionaire investor George Soros further upset the Congress and prompted it to revive the move. Leaders of Opposition parties claimed they had collected the signatures required from all INDIA bloc parties for giving the notice. Last day of nomination for December 20 Rajya Sabha bypolls Tuesday will mark the last day of nominations for the Rajya Sabha bypolls in four states, necessitated either by the resignation of sitting MPs. The bypolls will be held on December 20 to fill three vacant seats in Andhra Pradesh and one each in Odisha, West Bengal and Haryana. While the seats in Andhra fell vacant due to the resignation of three YSR Congress Party (YSRCP) members – Mopidevi Venkataramana, Beedha Mastan Rao and R Krishnaiah – the seats in Odisha and Bengal were vacated by Sujeet Kumar (BJD) and Jawahar Sircar (TMC), respectively. The seat in Haryana fell vacant after Krishan Lal Panwar was elected as MLA. The BJP has renominated Krishnaiah from Andhra, former National Commission for Women (NCW) chairperson Rekha Sharma from Haryana and Kumar from Odisha while the TMC has fielded Ritabrata Banerjee. The remaining two seats in Andhra have been given to the Telugu Desam Party (TDP), which is yet to make a formal announcement but is likely to renominate Rao and field businessman Satish Sana Babu for the two seats. – With PTI inputs","category":"politics"},{"publishedAt":"2024-12-11","title":"In its Adani protests in Parliament, Congress takes gloves off, tries everything else","description":"Tuesday’s protest has Congress MPs wearing masks of either PM Modi or Adani, with Rahul Gandhi “interviewing” them on their relationship.","urlToImage":"https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/12/noida-airport-feat-2.jpg?w=640","content":"Manickam Tagore is a Congress MP from Virudhunagar in Tamil Nadu; Shivaji Bandappa Kalge the party parliamentarian from Latur in Maharashtra. On Monday, the two were star performers as the Congress pumped up the drama around its protests over the Gautam Adani issue in Parliament. Kalge wore a Narendra Modi mask and Tagore one depicting Gautam Adani as, in a “spontaneous” decision, Rahul Gandhi interviewed them on the House premises over their “special relationship” – in what a Congress MP described as “a moment of creativity by all three of them”. The masks were the latest addition to the techniques the Congress has deployed in the Winter Session to highlight its campaign alleging favouritism towards the Adani Group under the Modi government. The party decided to turn to these after the first week of Winter Session was wiped out, with repeated adjournments meaning it could not raise the issue inside the House. Also Read | Congress MPs protest in Parliament with Modi and Adani masks, Rahul asks them about their relationship So last Monday began with the government and Opposition reaching an agreement to not stall proceedings in the House. The Congress was also urged by its own members and alliance partners, who wanted to raise other concerns in the House, to not be obstinate about the Adani issue. Leader of Opposition in the Lok Sabha Rahul Gandhi with Congress MPs Manickam Tagore and Saptagiri Sankar Ulaka, wearing face masks of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Adani Group Chairman Gautam Adani, at a protest demanding a probe into the bribery case in the US involving the billionaire industrialist. (PTI) A meeting of the Congress Parliamentary Strategy Group held the same day decided “to come up with new ways to highlight the Adani issue”. “We were told by Rahul ji to come up with ideas. Since then, we have come up with different ways to make the protest more eye-catching,” said a Congress MP, who was part of that meeting. “This way, we are not stalling the House, and also bringing attention to an issue which we feel must reach the people.” On Tuesday and Wednesday last week, Congress leaders and MPs of other INDIA bloc parties came to the House bearing a big black banner reading: “Modi-Adani are one”. On Thursday, they wore black jackets with a sticker affixed: “Modi Adani ek hai, Adani safe hai (Modi-Adani are one, Adani is safe)”. It was a play on Modi’s preferred campaign slogan during the recent Maharashtra elections, “Ek hain toh safe hain”. Rahul Gandhi stuck to his white T-shirt and khaki trousers look, fixing his sticker to the shirt. On Friday, Congress MPs came to Parliament holding pocket copies of the Constitution and wearing anti-pollution masks that had on them a similar message: “Modi, Adani bhai bhai (Modi, Adani are brothers)”. A Congress MP said that another reason for the new style of protests was that “the press was not taking an active interest in the Adani issue, and we needed to change that”. Monday’s “interview” certainly grabbed eyeballs, not the least because Gandhi was central to it. Several Congress MPs wore either the Modi or the Adani mask to Parliament Monday, and ensured that the cameras caught them hugging or shaking hands in the Parliament complex. “We wanted to show the partnership between the two,” said a Congress MP who was part of the protest. According to the MP, Gandhi then picked two of them – one wearing a “Modi” mask, and the other an “Adani” one – and led them closer to where the reporters were stationed, before doing an “impromptu” question-and-answer session. Also Read | ‘Must fight against anti-India forces unitedly,’ says Kiren Rijiju, day after BJP alleges George Soros-Congress links “Aaj kal kya ho raha hai bhai (What is happening these days, brother)?” Gandhi began the conversation. Tagore as ‘Adani’, with his arm around Kalge as ‘Modi’, replied: “Main jo bhi bolta hoon, yeh karta hai. Main kuchch bhi chahta hoon, port chahiye, airport chahiye (Whatever I say, he does. Whatever I want – airports, ports)….” Gandhi then asks, “What are you trying to get these days?” A pat Tagore replies: “We have a meeting in the evening.” Gandhi then asks about their relationship, to which Tagore says: “We are the same. We will do everything together… We have been together for years.” On their future, Tagore says: “India is nothing but me.” Why is he (Modi) not letting Parliament run “because of you (Adani)”, Gandhi then asks Tagore. “That man is missing. Amit bhai didn’t come to the House. We will have to ask Amit bhai,” Tagore says. Asked by Gandhi next on why ‘Modi’ (that is, Kalge) was so quiet and was not talking much these days, Tagore says: “He is in tension.” The Opposition MPs break into laughter. Congress MPs said that while the masks were a part of the plan, the interview by Gandhi was not. “Rahul ji just came and started asking questions to the two of them. It was all done in a matter of three-four minutes. Even the two MPs weren’t expecting the questions and weren’t prepared, but they went along,” the Congress MP who hailed “the creativity” of the three said. Party leaders said that since last week, during the meeting of Congress MPs at 10.15 am daily, there is a discussion on the next day’s protest, and depending on the views of the MPs, an idea is finalised. A senior MP has been given the responsibility of sourcing and readying the material, whether masks, banners etc. “The MP is doing it with the help of Congress youth organisations, and he is the one who brings the material to Parliament every morning,” said a colleague. There is no question of easing up on Adani, party leaders indicated, talking about Gandhi’s declaration at a press conference on November 21, days before the start of the Winter Session, that the issue will be among the key ones the party will raise. If there is disappointment that allies like the Samajwadi Party and Trinamool Congress are not participating in the protests, the party has put them aside. A Congress MP said: “The country will see more such protests over the next few days. Maybe these will be more creative.”","category":"politics"}]}
