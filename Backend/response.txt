In a 2019 interview during an official engagement, she revealed her enjoyment of cooking with her children, a surprisingly ordinary activity for a future queen. Prince William has a particular fondness for a classic British dish: roast chicken. Kate frequently prepares this meal for her husband, according to royal correspondent Katie Nicholl. As Nicholl told Vanity Fair in 2012, ‚ÄúIn the evenings she indulges her hobby of cooking William‚Äôs favourite supper, roast chicken.‚Äù These glimpses into the couple‚Äôs private life offer a reminder of their early days together in Wales. From 2010 to 2013, William and Kate lived on the Isle of Anglesey while William served as a search and rescue pilot with the Royal Air Force. <div overflow=\"\" role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\"></div> While roast chicken is a personal favourite of William‚Äôs, the Royal Family enjoys a diverse range of cuisines. During a visit to St. Luke‚Äôs Community Centre in 2018, Kate joined the children in making pizzas, sharing, ‚ÄúI‚Äôve done that with George and Charlotte making pizza dough. They love it because they can get their hands messy.‚Äù View this post on Instagram A post shared by The Prince and Princess of Wales (@princeandprincessofwales) Kate and William promoted the Commonwealth Big Lunch project in 2018, an international initiative encouraging community gatherings. The couple is known to enjoy takeaway meals, with Indian or Chinese cuisine being their favourites. In a 2017 interview with BBC Radio 1 host Scott Mills, the Prince and Princess of Wales confirmed that they can order takeaways. Kate revealed her preference for curry, while William admitted to being ‚Äúnot so good with spice‚Äù. Even Queen Camilla, with access to the finest cuisine, enjoys the occasional takeaway. In an interview with her son, Tom Parker Bowles, for YOU Magazine, she revealed her love for traditional fish and chips. ‚ÄúFreshly cooked fish and chips wrapped in paper‚Äîthat smell. You cannot beat proper fish and chips,‚Äù she admitted with a hint of nostalgia. Camilla‚Äôs culinary preference echoes that of her late mother-in-law, Queen Elizabeth II, who was also known to enjoy fish and chips. üì£ For more lifestyle news, click here to join our WhatsApp Channel and also follow us on Instagram","category":"lifestyle"},{"publishedAt":"2024-10-22","title":"Dietary restriction or good genes: new study tries to unpick which has a greater impact on lifespan","description":"So, while we can't pick our parents or change the genes we inherit from them, it is interesting to know that specific genetic variations play a significant role in the maximum age we can aspire to.","urlToImage":"https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/10/dieting_600_getty.jpg?w=640","content":"As people who research ageing like to quip: the best thing you can do to increase how long you live is to pick good parents. After all, it has long been recognised that longer-lived people tend to have longer-lived parents and grandparents, suggesting that genetics influence longevity. Complicating the picture, however, is that we know that the sum of your lifestyle, specifically diet and exercise, also significantly influences your health into older age and how long you live. What contribution lifestyle versus genetics makes is an open question that a recent study in Nature has shed new light on. <div overflow=\"\" role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\"></div> Scientists have long known that reducing calorie intake can make animals live longer. In the 1930s, it was noted that rats fed reduced calories lived longer than rats who could eat as much as they wanted. Similarly, people who are more physically active tend to live longer. But specifically linking single genes to longevity was until recently a controversial one. While studying the lifespan of the tiny worm C elegans at the University of California, San Francisco, Cynthia Kenyon found that small changes to the gene that controls the way that cells detect and respond to nutrients around them led to the worms doubling their lifespan. This raises new questions: if we know that genetics and lifestyle affect how long you live, which one is more important? And how do they interact? To try to tease out the effects of genetics versus lifestyle, the new study in Nature examined different models of caloric restriction in 960 mice. The researchers specifically looked at classical experimental models of caloric restriction (either 20 per cent or 40 per cent fewer calories than control mice), or intermittent fasting of one or two days without food (as intermittent fasting is popular in people looking to see the positive benefits of caloric restriction). Because we now know that small genetic variations affect ageing, the researchers specifically used genetically diverse mice. This is important for two reasons. First, as laboratory studies on mice are normally performed on genetically very (very!) similar mice, this allowed the researchers to tease out the effects of both diet and genetic variables would have on longevity. Let‚Äôs understand more (Source: Getty Images/Thinkstock) Second, humans are highly diverse, meaning that studies on genetically near-identical mice don‚Äôt often translate into humanity‚Äôs high genetic diversity. The headline finding was that genetics appeared to play a larger role in lifespan than any of the dietary restriction interventions. Long-lived types of mice were still longer lived despite dietary changes. Diet counts, but genes count more And while shorter-lived mice did show improvements as a result of dietary restrictions, they didn‚Äôt catch up to their longer-lived peers. This suggests that there‚Äôs truth to the ‚Äúpick good parents‚Äù joke. Caloric restriction models still increased lifespans across all the types of mice, with the 40 per cent restriction group having improved average and maximum lifespans compared with the 20 per cent group. And the 20 per cent group showed improvements in both group average and maximum length of lives compared with the control group. It‚Äôs just the effects of genetics were larger than the effect of the dietary interventions. While all the caloric restriction models resulted in increased lifespan in the mice on average, in the most extreme caloric restriction model tested (40 per cent less group) changes that could be seen as physical harms were observed. These included reduced immune function and losses in muscle mass, which outside of a predator- and germ-free laboratory environment could affect health and longevity. There are some important caveats in studies like this. First, it‚Äôs not known if these results apply to humans. As with most caloric restriction research in mice, the restricted feeding groups were fed 20 per cent or 40 per cent less than a control group who ate as much as they wanted. In humans, that‚Äôd be like assuming people eating every meal every day at a bottomless buffet is ‚Äúnormal‚Äù. And people who do not eat from limitless trays of food are ‚Äúrestricted feeding‚Äù. That‚Äôs not an exact parallel to how humans live and eat. Second, although exercise wasn‚Äôt controlled in any way in this study, most groups did similar amounts of running in their in-cage running wheels except the 40 per cent caloric restriction group who ran significantly more. The researchers suggested that this extra exercise in the 40 per cent group was the mice constantly hunting for more food. But as this group did so much more exercise than the others, it could also mean that positive effects of increased exercise were also seen in this group alongside their caloric restriction.

A neuroscientist explains how genes and diet shape taste So, while we can‚Äôt pick our parents or change the genes we inherit from them, it is interesting to know that specific genetic variations play a significant role in the maximum age we can aspire to. The genetic cards we‚Äôre dealt dictate how long we can expect to live. Just as important in this study, however, lifestyle interventions such as diet and exercise that aim to improve lifespan should be effective regardless of the genes we have. üì£ For more lifestyle news, click here to join our WhatsApp Channel and also follow us on Instagram","category":"lifestyle"},{"publishedAt":"2024-10-22","title":"Mahima Chaudhry reveals how parents got to know about her cancer diagnosis: ‚ÄòI had not disclosed‚Äô","description":"In a recent interview, Mahima opened up about how her parents found out about her cancer diagnosis.","urlToImage":"https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/10/mahima-chaudhry.jpg?w=640","content":"Bollywood actor Mahima Chaudhry, best known for her roles in films like Pardes and Dhadkan, has emerged as a beacon of strength and inspiration ever since her breast cancer diagnosis became public in June 2022. While her battle against the illness has touched countless lives, the revelation of her diagnosis came unexpectedly ‚Äî through an emotional video shared by co-actor Anupam Kher on Instagram. What made this moment more poignant was that Mahima‚Äôs parents learned about her condition through this very video. In a recent interview with¬†Brut India, Mahima opened up about how her parents found out about her cancer diagnosis, adding that she had not shared the news with them personally yet. While working on a publicity shoot for a film, Mahima had a casual conversation with Anupam Kher, during which she discussed her cancer journey. Unbeknownst to her, The Kashmir Files actor recorded parts of their conversation. <div overflow=\"\" role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\"></div> What followed was a candid moment captured on camera. Kher, moved by the raw honesty in her words, showed the video to Mahima‚Äôs sister. Encouraged by her sister‚Äôs positive response, he decided to upload the video to his Instagram page. The video quickly gained attention, and it was through this post that even Mahima‚Äôs father discovered her diagnosis. Recalling the moment, Mahima shared, ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt know but Anupam sir tried to take pictures/shots from different angles and then he started questioning. I was so spontaneous that I started to reply. And then he found it so good that he showed it to my sister, saying ‚ÄòKya fatak si light main shoot kiya, yeh bolti chali gaye aur fir cut hogaya‚Äô, and my sister was like ‚Äòfantastic, upload kardo‚Äô.

There‚Äôs a fascinating reason for that, and it‚Äôs called the peak-end rule. This little trick of the mind can actually help you enjoy life more, once you know how it works. Sandeep Karode, a content creator, speaks about this at length. In a reel posted on Instagram, he shares, ‚ÄúThe peak end rule is a psychological heuristic that determines how we remember an experience. So the experience could be longer and more uncomfortable. But if the peak of that experience was a good one and the experience ended on a good note, even though the unpleasant experience was longer, you will not remember it like that.‚Äù <div overflow=\"\" role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\"></div> View this post on Instagram A post shared by Sandeep Karode (@sandeepkarode) Imagine if you could make your days, weeks, or even years feel better overall, just by focusing on certain moments. Sounds too good to be true, right? Well, that‚Äôs exactly what the peak-end rule is all about. The psychological mechanisms behind the peak-end rule Neha Cadabam, senior psychologist and executive director at Cadabams Hospitals, says, ‚ÄúThe peak-end rule is a cognitive bias where we judge an experience based primarily on how we felt at its peak (the most intense point) and its end, rather than the overall sum or average of every moment.‚Äù This is due to two key psychological mechanisms: *Duration Neglect: Our brains tend to discount the duration of an experience when forming memories. We might remember a short but intensely pleasurable moment more vividly than a longer, less intense period. *Retrospective Evaluation: When recalling an experience, we tend to summarise it by focusing on the most salient moments, which often include the peak and end. This cognitive shortcut simplifies our memories and helps us make quick judgments. Applying the peak-end rule in daily life By understanding the peak-end rule, Cadabam says, we can intentionally create more positive experiences: Create Peak Moments: Actively seek out and savour peak experiences in your daily life. This could be anything from a delicious meal to a beautiful sunset to a meaningful conversation. End on a High Note: End your day or activities with a positive ritual. This could be reading a few pages of a book, listening to your favorite song, or spending a few minutes reflecting on something you‚Äôre grateful for. Break Up Monotonous Tasks: If you have a long, boring task, break it into smaller chunks and add enjoyable elements throughout or reward yourself with a small treat at the end. Focus on Positive Memories: When reminiscing about past experiences, try to focus on the positive peaks and endings to enhance your overall recollection. End your day or activities with a positive ritual. (Source: Freepik) Limitations or criticisms of the peak-end rule The peak-end rule is a powerful heuristic, but it‚Äôs not without limitations. Cadabam informs, ‚ÄúNot everyone is equally susceptible to the peak-end rule. People with a higher tendency towards nostalgia or those who are more present-focused might be less influenced by it.‚Äù Some cultures place more emphasis on the overall experience rather than specific peak or end moments, she adds. ‚ÄúIntentionally manipulating experiences to create positive peaks and endings could be seen as deceptive or manipulative.‚Äù The peak-end rule might not apply to all types of experiences. For example, events with a strong narrative structure, like a movie or a concert, might be evaluated differently. üì£ For more lifestyle news, click here to join our WhatsApp Channel and also follow us on Instagram","category":"lifestyle"},{"publishedAt":"2024-10-22","title":"Sonam Kapoor sports the moon phase tattoo with her Karwa Chauth look ‚Äî here‚Äôs what it signifies","description":"Taking to Instagram, she shared that even though she was not keeping a fast this year, she loved indulging in the food and applying mehendi.","urlToImage":"https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/10/463661543_18468337234009229_2607811659355837258_n.jpg?w=640","content":"Sonam Kapoor celebrates Karwa Chauth with lots of fun, food, and style.

According to Dr Abhisar Katiyar, Consultant ‚Äì Orthopaedics & Joint Replacement at Yatharth Hospital, Greater Noida, a re-injury to a previously operated leg can lead to significant complications. ‚ÄúA second injury places additional strain on healing tissues, bones, or ligaments, which can disrupt the recovery process. In some cases, it can lead to inflammation, infections, or even affect the structural integrity of the operated site,‚Äù Dr Katiyar explained. For someone like Pant, who already has surgical hardware in his knee, a re-injury could further complicate recovery and might require additional medical interventions. Dr Katiyar also emphasised that athletes who experience repeated injuries to the same area may face long-term issues, including reduced joint flexibility, chronic pain, and an increased risk of arthritis. Therefore, a structured rehabilitation program is crucial to ensure full recovery and prevent future setbacks. Sarfaraz Khan with teammate Rishabh Pant celebrates his 150 runs during the fourth day of the first test cricket match between India and New Zealand at M Chinnaswamy Stadium, in Bengaluru. (PTI) Pant‚Äôs return to full fitness will be a carefully managed process. Recovery from a leg injury generally involves multiple stages: initial immobilisation, gradual mobilisation, physical therapy, and strength rebuilding, Dr Katiyar explained. For elite athletes, rest, proper nutrition, and adherence to a tailored rehabilitation plan are critical to ensuring a full recovery without risking further injury. However, the pressure on athletes to perform can sometimes lead to premature returns to the field, something Pant and the Indian team must avoid at all costs.

This is possibly the simplest explanation of life coaching, a practice that began some four decades back but gained prominence in the last few years. Ever wondered why the demand for life coaching is on the rise and how one can become a life coach? The confusion around becoming a¬†life coach often stems from the fact that no exceptional educational qualifications are required, making it seem like anyone can step into the role. However, Gudh contended that this profession is best suited for individuals who possess a genuine desire to contribute, a curiosity to explore life‚Äôs deeper meanings, and a strong growth mindset. ‚ÄúThese are the traits that make someone truly eligible to thrive in this industry,‚Äù he said. <div overflow=\"\" role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\"></div> Where is the need? Life coaches help clients align with their life or career goals, offering guidance on business, personal growth, and well-being. ‚ÄúThey focus on mindfulness and meditation, viewing clients as healthy individuals striving for growth,‚Äù says Dr Rahul Rai Kakkar, consultant psychiatrist at Narayana Hospital, Gurugram. With social media platforms, life coaches are widely available and accessible now. But wait‚Ä¶How are they different from psychologists? While life coaches and psychologists work towards the same goal of improving lives, their methods differ. ‚ÄúPsychologists are trained professionals with advanced degrees in psychology and licensed to diagnose and treat mental health conditions,‚Äù said¬†Navneet Kaur, transformational and communication coach. Life coaches, though trained by coaching organisations, don‚Äôt require licensing, said Dr Kakkar. Gudh told¬†indianexpress.com that psychologists often focus on understanding issues rooted in the past using therapeutic techniques to address emotional and psychological concerns. ‚ÄúIn some cases, individuals may need support from a psychiatrist, a professional trained to deal with brain anatomy and prescribe medication if and when necessary,‚Äù he said. Life coaches, on the other hand, work with ‚Äúfully-functional individuals‚Äù who feel stuck or believe they‚Äôre not reaching their full potential, according to Gudh. Life coaches have an orientation towards personal development and goal achievement, Kaur said, which are often more focused on future rather than past traumas. ‚ÄúThey are not therapists or providers of therapy or treatment of any kind of psychological disorder, even if they use motivational techniques,‚Äù said Kaur. Skills and training Life coaches are trained in skills like active listening, effective questioning, empathy, goal setting, and accountability strategies. However, formal education isn‚Äôt required, though ‚Äúcertification in coaching is supposed to be an important step forward and provides one with so much credibility within the field,‚Äù said Kaur. For those aspiring to become life coaches, Gudh apprised¬†us that the International Coaching Federation (ICF) offers a formal training and certification pathway. ‚ÄúThis structured education system helps aspiring coaches develop the skills necessary for professional practice. The ICF certification process includes three levels: Level 1 prepares you for the Associate Certified Coach (ACC) credential, Level 2 is aimed at becoming a Professional Certified Coach (PCC), and Level 3 focuses on Master Coach certification. Completing these levels equips you with the knowledge and training to practice as a licensed and professional coach,‚Äù he said. What‚Äôs the difference between a mental health professional and a life coach? (Source: Getty Images/Thinkstock) How much do life coaches and mental¬†health professionals earn? Dr Kakkar said that psychologists generally earn more than life coaches due to their advanced education and licensing, often working in clinical or academic settings. ‚ÄúOn the other hand, life coaches focus on personal development and goal-setting, with earnings varying based on their client base, experience, and reputation,‚Äù said Dr Kakkar. Psychologists typically earn between Rs 4 lakh to Rs 10 lakh per year. Experienced ones make over Rs 12 lakh. ‚ÄúLife coaches usually earn around Rs 2.5 lakhs to Rs 6.5 lakh, though top coaches can make Rs 8 lakh or more. Psychologists generally have more stable incomes due to formal training, while life coaches‚Äô earnings vary with experience and reputation,‚Äù said Dr Kakkar. Steps to become a life coach Here‚Äôs a guide from Kaur to become a life coach: Self-assessment:¬†Individuals interested in coaching should assess their strengths, experiences, and passion for helping others. ‚ÄúStrong communication¬†skills, empathy, and a positive mindset are essential traits for effective coaching,‚Äù said Kaur. Education and training:¬†A formal degree is not necessary but holding an accreditation will boost credibility. ‚ÄúThey mostly cover coaching techniques, ethics, communications, and goal setting,‚Äù said Kaur. Practice:¬†Practice is necessary as the efficiency of coaching would best be obtained with experience. Aspiring coaches can just start by offering their services to friends or volunteering gradually until skills and confidence build up. Niche:¬†Developing a niche practice, like career coaching, wellness coaching or relationship coaching enables individual coaches to stand out in the crowd. Marketing:¬†Through a website and social networking sites, coaches can now connect with clients directly. ‚ÄúNetworking with professional practitioners in the specific domain likewise opens up access to referral sources,‚Äù said Kaur. When should one consider these services? If you‚Äôre dealing with deep emotional issues or mental health conditions like depression or OCD, a psychologist or psychiatrist is necessary. However, if you‚Äôre focused on achieving life goals, improving career prospects, or boosting confidence, a life coach might be more suitable. ‚ÄúLife coaches are generally more accessible and affordable, while psychologists can be more expensive.

Engaging in new endeavours fosters resilience, as it keeps the mind and body engaged, helping people find purpose and meaning despite their grief.‚Äù By staying active and pursuing goals, she says that individuals often experience a renewed sense of vitality, ‚Äúdemonstrating that life doesn‚Äôt stop with loss, it continues to evolve.‚Äù Cherishing the memories of a loved one while simultaneously embracing new opportunities allows for personal growth, honouring both the past and the present. It is normal to feel unsure about change, but by aligning new goals with activities that resonate with you, you can start to live life more fully and within your own capabilities. (Source: Freepik) Importance of staying engaged and active, particularly after a life-altering event ‚ÄúStaying engaged and active after a life-altering event is crucial, but it doesn‚Äôt mean immediately jumping into new activities or bypassing the pain,‚Äù stresses Baruah. It‚Äôs important to clarify that staying engaged doesn‚Äôt equate to avoiding or ignoring grief. Acknowledging and processing emotions is key to healing. Alongside moving forward, one must allow space to feel the pain and honour the loss. Baruah states, ‚ÄúRemaining active helps prevent losing oneself in prolonged sadness, depression, or becoming stuck in the past. Without balancing grief and forward movement, there‚Äôs a risk of holding onto the past without embracing the present or future. Many people also experience post-traumatic growth (PTSG), where the challenging event pushes them to find new meaning and purpose in life. This growth often stems from a realisation that life is impermanent, and the present moment is all we truly have to live. This sense of purpose allows individuals to move forward while processing their pain and ultimately grow stronger from the experience.‚Äù Advice for those who feel hesitant to take on new challenges later in life, especially after years of fulfilling a specific role According to Baruah, the first step is to ‚Äútake time to sit with oneself and truly acknowledge the emotions they are experiencing.‚Äù It‚Äôs important to check in with your feelings and allow space for whatever grief, uncertainty, or hesitation is present. Before jumping into any future plans, it‚Äôs crucial to sit with those raw emotions and understand what‚Äôs going on internally. This process can feel overwhelming, and the initial impulse may be to dismiss it or avoid thinking about the future altogether. However, taking this time for a reality check helps in navigating the path ahead. Once these emotions are acknowledged, you can gradually carve out a future plan ‚Äî asking yourself ‚ÄòWhat‚Äôs next?‚Äô or ‚ÄòHow will life move forward?‚Äô Hesitance to take on new challenges will diminish once you‚Äôve allowed yourself to process these thoughts. After this self-reflection, focus on listing the activities, hobbies, or rituals you‚Äôve always loved or are passionate about, be it socialising with friends, spending time with family, or pursuing a career or hobby that excites you, suggests Baruah. She adds, ‚ÄúPsychologically, this process helps rebuild your sense of self and identity, especially after spending years in a specific role like caregiver or partner. It is normal to feel unsure about change, but by aligning new goals with activities that resonate with you, you can start to live life more fully and within your own capabilities. This shift allows for a more balanced perspective, where you embrace both the past and the future, slowly moving toward a life that feels purposeful and meaningful once again.‚Äù üì£ For more lifestyle news, click here to join our WhatsApp Channel and also follow us on Instagram","category":"lifestyle"},{"publishedAt":"2024-10-22","title":"This is when you should have your last meal of the day","description":"Leaving an adequate interval between your last meal and bedtime is critical for various reasons, including health, digestion, and overall well-being","urlToImage":"https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/08/dinner-pexels.jpg?w=640","content":"The adage ‚Äútiming is everything‚Äù holds particularly true when it comes to our eating habits. When to consume our final meal of the day is an important decision to make. And when you do so, don‚Äôt forget those pesky packets of chips you inhale every night after dinner. Kanikka Malhotra, consultant dietician and diabetes educator helped us understand why this time is important. Why should there be enough gap between your last meal and your sleeping time? Leaving an adequate interval between your last meal and bedtime is critical for various reasons, including health, digestion, and overall well-being. Allowing time for digestion before sleeping helps to avoid discomforts such as acid reflux or indigestion, as eating too close to bedtime can cause these problems, disturbing sleep quality and comfort, Malhotra explained. <div overflow=\"\" role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\"></div> She added that a prolonged fasting interval between your last meal and breakfast (preferably 12 to 14 hours) promotes metabolic processes and can boost fat burning, helping the body to repair and renew while lowering the risk of metabolic illnesses such as obesity and diabetes. Eating late at night can also upset the balance of hormones that govern hunger and metabolism, potentially boosting ghrelin (the hunger hormone) and reducing adiponectin (which aids in glucose regulation), resulting in increased appetite and probable weight gain. To improve health, it is typically recommended that you finish your last meal at least 2 to 3 hours before bedtime, Malhotra said. This ensures optimal digestion and promotes better metabolic health, cardiovascular function, and sleep quality. Late dinners are common in many Indian households, with families often eating around 9:00 or 9:30 pm. At what time should the last meal of your day be? The ideal time for your last meal of the day, whether it‚Äôs dinner or a snack, is generally recommended to be between 6:00 PM and 8:00 PM, Malhotra said. Dinner timings: Optimal Window: 6:00 PM to 8:00 PM Reason: Eating dinner at this interval is linked to improved digestion and sleep quality. According to studies, eating dinner before 9:00 PM can improve fat metabolism and overall health outcomes, especially for people who are at risk of obesity and type 2 diabetes. Eating too close to bedtime can disturb both sleep and digestion. Evening snacks: Ideal Time: If you prefer a snack, consuming it between 8:30 PM and 9:30 PM is best. Guidelines: Choose light, easily digestible options such as fruit, yoghurt, or nuts. Avoid heavy or sugary snacks close to bedtime, as they can interfere with sleep quality. Malhotra added that to improve your health and sleep quality, aim to finish your last meal, whether it is dinner or a snack, by 9:00 PM. If you decide to nibble later, stick to lighter selections and aim to eat by 9:30 PM at the latest.

So, it becomes difficult to reconcile the confident actor, shining in her light, with the shy and apprehensive Triptii from when she first arrived in Mumbai. ‚ÄúNone of it would have been possible without making it through the early days of my acting career. When I first came to Mumbai, I didn‚Äôt even know how to interact with people. I wouldn‚Äôt be able to sleep the day before an audition. I would sit and prepare for meetings all night long,‚Äù Triptii revealed in a recent interview with Grazia India. ‚ÄúI think facing the camera, knowing that there are a hundred other people in front of you auditioning for the same job, fills you up with a different kind of energy. Day in and day out, we would just be reading lines and getting our pictures taken. You wake up, you go for auditions, you come back, and then you repeat it all over again. If you were lucky, you would get selected for two of those, or maybe one in a year. Aram Nagar was basically my second home. That taught me a lot, and I was lucky because I kept meeting the right people who guided me in the right direction,‚Äù she added.<div overflow=\"\" role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\"></div> View this post on Instagram A post shared by Vicky Kaushal (@vickykaushal09) Building confidence, like Triptii has shown, is a gradual process that requires self-awareness, consistent effort, and compassion towards oneself. According to Arouba Kabir, emotional and mental health professional, and founder of Enso Wellness, confidence is not about never feeling unsure‚Äîit‚Äôs about learning to manage those feelings and push forward. Here‚Äôs how she suggests doing that: Set small, realistic goals Start by identifying specific areas where you feel underconfident. Is it your communication skills, the way you present yourself, or even something as specific as your makeup skills? Once you‚Äôve pinpointed the issue, set small, achievable goals that can help you improve gradually, Kabir said. For example, if you feel underconfident about public speaking, begin by practising in front of a mirror or a small, supportive group. By achieving these small goals, you build up your confidence in manageable steps. Develop relevant skills Confidence often comes from competence. If you‚Äôre lacking in a particular skill, take steps to improve it. Whether it‚Äôs through workshops, classes, or self-practice, developing the necessary skills in your area of interest can significantly boost your confidence. This might involve social skills, professional skills, or even creative talents. Investing time in learning will make you feel more prepared and capable in those situations. Seek constructive feedback Receiving feedback is crucial for growth. Kabir emphasises the importance of asking for constructive criticism from trusted individuals. Feedback can offer insights into areas where you can improve, and when it‚Äôs constructive, it helps you adjust and refine your approach without damaging your self-esteem. Practice self-compassion It‚Äôs essential to be kind to yourself during this journey. Kabir stresses the importance of self-compassion and recognising even small achievements. If you attempt something new and don‚Äôt excel immediately, remind yourself that progress, not perfection, is the goal. Celebrate the fact that you took a step outside your comfort zone, even if the results weren‚Äôt perfect. Positive self-talk is key; instead of saying ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not good at this,‚Äù shift to ‚ÄúI‚Äôm still learning, and I will get better.‚Äù Building confidence is a step-by-step process that involves setting realistic goals, improving skills, seeking feedback, practising self-compassion, and maintaining a positive outlook. By focusing on incremental progress and learning to appreciate your efforts, you can gradually enhance your confidence in any area of life. üì£ For more lifestyle news, click here to join our WhatsApp Channel and also follow us on Instagram","category":"lifestyle"},{"publishedAt":"2024-10-22","title":"Neurologist says waking up to alarms can cause ‚Äòsignificant upsurge‚Äô in blood pressure; know more","description":"Dr Manjusha Agarwal, senior consultant, internal medicine, Gleneagles Hospitals¬†Parel¬†Mumbai said this practice of waking up to an alarm can greatly affect \"both your physical and psychological well-being\".","urlToImage":"https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/09/alarm-sleeping_1600_getty_1600.jpg?w=640","content":"Alarms are saviours that help many of us wake up in the morning.

To tackle it, she began working out regularly. ‚ÄúNow fitness has become a part of life. But it‚Äôs more to do with stamina. When you are shooting for such long hours, initially, I overestimated how much my body can endure. But it does put a physical strain on you. There were so many injuries happening; I was getting injured on every set,‚Äù Maniktala, 27, said. She also recollected how, owing to a ligament injury, she had to shoot most of her scenes while sitting during A Suitable Boy. ‚ÄúI had a bad ligament tear because of which I couldn‚Äôt walk. Many scenes have been choreographed in a way where I am sitting, and everybody around me is walking. Every other shoot, I would have some injury. I realised that my body could not take the strain of these long hours. So not just as a weight loss goal, but to keep fit. It (exercising) also helps you with your mental health. Now, I do prioritise working out. It makes me happy. It is not about a body goal but if my body can endure and keep going,‚Äù the actor said on the YouTube show Khaane Mein Kya Hai. <div overflow=\"\" role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\"></div> Taking a cue, let‚Äôs understand the relationship between workouts and injury prevention. Dr Udit Kapoor, consultant orthopaedic, Metro Hospital, Faridabad said lifting weights provides resistance, which is essential for muscle hypertrophy (growth) and increasing muscle strength. ‚ÄúThe progressive overload principle, which involves gradually increasing the weight or resistance, forces muscles to adapt and grow stronger, which reduces injuries when done with correct form,‚Äù said Dr Kapoor. Exercise improves neuromuscular coordination, which increases the efficiency and speed of muscle contractions, contributing to greater power and resistance. According to Dr Kapoor, bodyweight exercises that mimic natural, functional movements, enhance everyday physical capabilities and reduce the risk of injury. ‚ÄúWeight-bearing exercises such as lifting and jumping increase bone density, contributing to overall musculoskeletal health,‚Äù said Dr Kapoor. According to Dr Kapoor, high-intensity activities like sprinting elevate the metabolic rate, aiding fat loss and improving body composition, which indirectly supports muscle function and endurance. Incorporating a variety of exercises and fitness routines in a training regimen ensures a balanced development of muscle strength, power, and endurance, leading to improved athletic performance and overall fitness that reduces the chances of injuries. Workouts help you stay fit (representative) (Source: Freepik) What to note when you return to fitness after a prolonged gap owing to injury? Dr Haricharan G, senior consultant physician, HoD, internal medicine, Gleneagles Hospitals, Lakdi Ka Pul, Hyderabad said returning to the gym or the mat after a long break requires a gradual approach to avoid injury relapse and ensure sustainable progress. *Start with a warm-up to increase blood flow to muscles and prepare your body for exercise. Begin with low-impact activities, focusing on lighter weights and lower intensity. ‚ÄúThis helps your muscles and joints reacclimate to physical activity and reduces the risk of strains or injuries,‚Äù said Dr Haricharan. *Incorporate dynamic stretching to improve flexibility and range of motion. *Pay attention your body‚Äôs signals, and avoid pushing too hard initially. ‚ÄúFocus on compound exercises that target multiple muscle groups to rebuild overall strength and endurance,‚Äù said Dr Haricharan. *Hydration and proper nutrition are also crucial. Fuel your body with a balanced diet of proteins, carbohydrates, and healthy fats to support muscle recovery and energy levels.

Now, the government says that weight-loss injections might be part of the solution and might even help boost Britain‚Äôs productivity, which has been sluggish for years. <div overflow=\"\" role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\"></div> Studies show that people with obesity are more likely to find that ill health affects their productivity and attendance at work. On Monday, the government announced a 279 million-pound (about $365 million) investment from pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly. Among other things, the investment will help explore new ways of delivering health services to people living with obesity and include a five-year trial of the company‚Äôs drug tirzepatide, also known as Mounjaro, which is used to treat diabetes and for weight loss. The trial, in the Greater Manchester area in northern England, will study the effectiveness of tirzepatide in bringing about weight loss, preventing diabetes and tackling obesity-related health conditions. It will also aim to collect data on whether the drug leads to changes in participants‚Äô employment status and sick days from work, according to a statement from the Health Innovation Network, the innovation arm of the NHS. The government said that up to 3,000 people could eventually take part in the study. Prime Minister Keir Starmer, speaking to BBC Breakfast on Tuesday, said he believed the drugs could be ‚Äúvery important for our economy and for health,‚Äù adding that tirzepatide ‚Äúwill be very helpful to people who want to lose weight, need to lose weight, very important for the economy so people can get back into work.‚Äù Wes Streeting, Britain‚Äôs health secretary, wrote in an opinion piece in The Telegraph that the country‚Äôs ‚Äúwidening waistbands are also placing significant burden on our health service,‚Äù noting that illnesses linked to obesity cost the country‚Äôs health service roughly $14 billion a year. ‚ÄúThe long-term benefits of these drugs could be monumental in our approach to tackling obesity,‚Äù Streeting wrote. ‚ÄúFor many people, these weight-loss jabs will be life-changing, help them get back to work and ease the demands on our NHS.‚Äù But he added that ‚Äúthere must remain a responsibility on us all to take healthy living more seriously‚Äù and said that the country‚Äôs health service ‚Äúcan‚Äôt be expected to always pick up the tab.‚Äù This month, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, a government agency that gives guidance to the NHS on medication and treatment, announced that tirzepatide would soon be available free of charge to people living with obesity and other weight-related health conditions. The agency said that nearly a quarter of a million people would be eligible to receive the injections under a three-year plan. (Tirzepatide and other weight-loss injections are available through private prescription in Britain.) Amanda Pritchard, CEO of the NHS, said that obesity was one of the biggest public health issues in the country. ‚ÄúWe know weight-loss drugs will be a game changer, alongside earlier prevention strategies, in supporting many more people to lose weight and reduce their risk of killer conditions like diabetes, heart attack and stroke,‚Äù she said in a statement. üì£ For more lifestyle news, click here to join our WhatsApp Channel and also follow us on Instagram","category":"lifestyle"},{"publishedAt":"2024-10-22","title":"Arjun Kanungo went vegan for 6 months to deal with an ‚Äòacute kidney injury‚Äô; can this diet help improve kidney health?","description":"The typical plant-based diet being high fibre improves gut health and intestinal motility and the antioxidants help reduce inflammation in the body.","urlToImage":"https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/09/439676947_18429154996058226_5631719471229794042_n.jpg?w=640","content":"Arjun Kanungo has been on a weight loss journey lately.

Indianexpress.com spoke to experts to find out the benefits of this diet in this regard. First of all, let‚Äôs clarify one thing, a vegan and a vegetarian diet are different from one another. A vegan/plant based diet excludes all animal products and byproducts including meat, eggs, fish, dairy, dairy products and honey. While vegetarians consume dairy, honey and sometimes eggs. How can a plant based diet improve kidney health? Nutritionist Namita Satheesh shared that a minimally processed plant-based diet tends to be much higher in fibre and antioxidants and has significant overall health benefits such as managing weight, lowering cholesterol, and lowering risk of diabetes. ‚ÄúMany animal-based foods such as red meat, organic meat and some seafood are high in a compound called purines. Purines, when broken down in the body form a waste product called uric acid which is then filtered through the kidneys are excreted from our body. Excess consumption of foods containing purines can lead to higher levels of uric acid, which can be difficult for the kidneys to properly process and thus can cause kidney stones and gout,‚Äù explained Satheesh. Naturally, most plant based foods are low in purine. The typical plant based diet being high fiber improves gut health and intestinal motility and the antioxidants help reduce inflammation in the body. ‚ÄúA vegan diet may help manage kidney problems and high creatinine levels by emphasizing plant-based foods, which are naturally lower in protein and phosphorus compared to animal products. This can reduce the workload on the kidneys, potentially slowing disease progression,‚Äù said C.V. Aishwarya, Lecturer and Clinical Nutritionist at Sri Ramachandra Institute of Higher Education and Research (DU), Chennai, Porur. Plant-based proteins (like beans, lentils, and tofu) produce fewer waste products, which may help lower creatinine levels. She also added that a vegan diet is rich in antioxidants and fiber, which helps support blood pressure and blood sugar control- some key factors in kidney health. ALSO READ | Three important things to consider before switching to a vegan diet Most plant based foods are low in purine. (Wikimedia Commons photo) But are there any health risks with going vegan suddenly? Satheesh said that there are absolutely no known health risks with switching to a plant-based diet overnight. She suggested watching out for certain deficiencies such as vitamin b12 and vitamin d3. However, these are equally prevalent among vegetarians and non vegetarians as well due to our current lifestyle. ‚ÄúIn case you are looking for some vegan protein sources, add tofu, tempeh, soy chunks, seitan, beans, lentils, pulses, plant-based protein powders, hemp seeds, and chia seeds to your diet as they offer good amounts of protein,‚Äù she advised.

As a result, people may overeat or snack on other unhealthy foods between meals, further increasing weight gain. Increased fat mass and reduced muscle mass: The lack of essential nutrients can increase the unhealthy fat mass and reduce the muscle mass. This in turn will reduce the metabolic rate, and lesser calories will be burnt. Increase in bad cholesterol: A low fiber diet, coupled with simple carbs is the perfect recipe to increase your bad cholesterol and triglycerides. What happens if you eat too much soya sauce? Soya sauce, while adding flavor, is well known for its high sodium content. Balaji said that a tablespoon of soy sauce can contain nearly 900 milligrams of sodium, which is almost 40% of the recommended daily intake. ‚ÄúA high-sodium diet is directly linked to elevated blood pressure, which increases the risk of heart disease, stroke, and kidney damage. Eating too much sodium can overburden the kidneys, leading to water retention, swelling, and, in extreme cases, kidney failure,‚Äù Balaji explained. According to her, this causes the body to retain water, leading to bloating, puffiness, and even more serious conditions like edema (swelling).

Both Veena and Balaji said that ramen should be an occasional indulgence, not a dietary staple. ‚ÄúFor those who enjoy ramen, limit it to once in 10 days, while pairing it with vegetables, lean proteins like chicken, and lower-sodium alternatives,‚Äù Balaji advised. People suffering from hypertension, kidney diseases, heart problems or a risk of developing stroke and those who are sensitive to gluten should stay away from ramen. üì£ For more lifestyle news, click here to join our WhatsApp Channel and also follow us on Instagram","category":"lifestyle"},{"publishedAt":"2024-10-22","title":"You could dance your way out of a panic attack","description":"Dancing can be a great stress buster, but can it stop a panic attack in its tracks?

According to her, the factors on which the taste of bananas depends are its color, ripeness, whether it is plump, bruised or split, and the presence or absence of dull gray undertones. ‚ÄúIf you want to consume them immediately, choose bright yellow bananas with little to no green around the ends. Some light brown speckling, a sign of ripeness and sweetness, is okay,‚Äù she said.

However, a deficiency in B12 can prove to be quite harmful to your body. How can you combat this? ‚ÄúVitamin B12 is mostly found in animal-derived foods‚Äù, says Kanikka Malhotra, Consultant Dietician & Diabetes Educator. As a result, people who eat a plant-based diet, such as vegans and severe vegetarians, are more likely to be deficient in vitamin B12. While not a primary source of B12, several plant-based milk replacements are fortified with this vital nutrient. The amount of B12 added to plant-based milk also varies significantly. Relying entirely on plant-based milk for B12 may not be sufficient. A varied plant-based diet including ‚Äúfortified cereals, nutritional yeast, and other B12 supplements‚Äù is frequently suggested.¬†The recommended B12 consumption varies according to age, gender, and overall health. Individuals with a B12 deficiency may require higher quantities than individuals with appropriate levels. <div overflow=\"\" role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\"></div> Do these drinks help? Unfortunately, no, says Kanikka. Solely relying on plant-based drinks cannot help combat your vitamin B12 deficiency.

Folate-Rich Foods Incorporate folate-rich foods like leafy greens (spinach, kale, collard greens), legumes (lentils, chickpeas, black beans), and fruits such as oranges, bananas, and avocados into your diet. 2. Vitamin B6 Sources Non-citrus fruits like bananas, along with nuts and seeds such as sunflower seeds and pistachios, are also great sources 3. Vitamin C-Rich Foods To enhance nutrient absorption, especially of non-heme iron, include vitamin C-rich foods like citrus fruits (oranges, grapefruits, lemons), berries (strawberries, blueberries), and vegetables such as bell peppers and broccoli. Vitamin C‚Äôs role in boosting iron absorption is particularly important for those who rely on fortified foods for their B12 intake. 4. Calcium-Containing Foods For overall bone health and to support B12 in nerve transmission, include calcium-rich foods in your diet. Dairy products like milk, cheese, and yogurt are excellent sources, as are fortified plant-based milks, tofu, and orange juice. Leafy greens such as kale and collard greens also provide a healthy dose of calcium. 5. Probiotic Foods Maintaining a healthy gut microbiome is essential for nutrient absorption, including B12. Incorporate probiotic-rich foods like yogurt with live cultures, kefir, sauerkraut, kimchi, miso, and tempeh into your diet to support gut health. 6. Magnesium-Rich Foods Magnesium plays a key role in many biochemical reactions, including those involving B12.

Comedian Hasan Minhaj posed for photos with actress Maitreyi Ramakrishnan, and Ali Sethi, a singer and songwriter, chatted with Avantika Vandanapu, who starred in ‚ÄúMean Girls,‚Äù the 2024 film. Minhaj, Ramakrishnan and Vandanapu were among the hosts for the night. Acharia said it was important to assemble a host committee that reflected the diversity of the roughly 2 billion people of South Asian descent around the world. ‚ÄúPre-partition, before we were broken up by the British, my mum tells me that everybody celebrated Diwali,‚Äù Acharia said about the holiday, which will be observed for the first time by New York City public schools on Nov. 1. ‚ÄúFor me, Diwali is an expression of South Asian culture.

It‚Äôs a collection of the whole South Asian diaspora, and I love just the idea of us highlighting light over darkness, especially given everything that‚Äôs happening in the world. And I think in terms of fashion, it‚Äôs a celebration of color, maximalism, joy, community. It‚Äôs such a very cool New York diaspora thing to be a part of. What your favorite South Asian food? Oh, this is divisive. Biryani is obvious, of course biryani. I feel like khichdi is slept on. Khichdi as a cuisine can be amazing ‚Äî any version. What I want is your mom‚Äôs version. That‚Äôs the go-to. It‚Äôs comfort, it‚Äôs love, it‚Äôs like a hug from your grandmother. Alok Vaid-Menon, writer and comedian Tell me about your outfit. I‚Äôm wearing one of my favorite designers named Papa Don‚Äôt Preach based out of Mumbai. Shubhika, the designer, is a dear friend of mine. She designed this outfit for me when I was performing in Mumbai earlier this year in February. Why is this gathering important to you? Growing up, Diwali was such an essential part of my life. I was always worried: Am I going to lose this as a queer and trans person? And it feels really important for my inner child as an adult to be able to be here as the fullest expression of myself. Because when I was younger, I couldn‚Äôt wear the things that I wanted to wear. Sabyasachi Mukherjee, fashion designer Did you grow up celebrating Diwali? I‚Äôm Bengali, so we don‚Äôt call it Diwali. We call it Kali Puja. I have very fond memories of it. My father used to make firecrackers at home, he taught me how to do it because he was a chemical engineer. Is this your first time coming to this event? Yes. It‚Äôs incredible how India is being recognized in the U.S. I came in yesterday, just for the party. I flew from Kolkata, and I fly back tomorrow morning. I‚Äôm absolutely jet-lagged out of my wits, but just being here makes me happy because you just realize you‚Äôre a part of a larger global network. Mira Nair, filmmaker Tell me about your outfit. It‚Äôs from Raw Mango, a little lovely company in Delhi. I got it for the opening night of my Brooklyn showing of ‚ÄúMonsoon Wedding‚Äù last July, and I‚Äôm repurposing it. What‚Äôs your favorite Diwali memory? I used to light lamps on Riverside Drive, where our home has been for 25 years, and pave the sidewalks with rangoli, but no one knew what I was doing. Now, it‚Äôs this. Now, it‚Äôs glam events. Sharmeen Obaid-Chinoy, filmmaker Tell me about your outfit. It‚Äôs made by a Pakistani, Zain Hashmi. What does this community mean to you? There are filmmakers, there are artists, there are businesspeople, there are people in sports. And the whole idea is we are a community, we are here and we are doing incredible things. And to be able to come together in Diwali or Eid or in any of these festivals together is a testament to the strength of people. What‚Äôs your go-to South Asian song? ‚ÄúPasoori‚Äù by Ali Sethi.

Prolonged vitamin D deficiency can lead to serious health issues. Osteoporosis, characterized by weakened bones, is a common consequence. This condition increases the risk of fractures. To prevent or address vitamin D deficiency, regular vitamin D supplements are often recommended. In cases of severe deficiency, vitamin D injections may be necessary. Many individuals experience a rapid improvement in symptoms within a few weeks of appropriate treatment. Individuals who have limited sun exposure are at a higher risk of vitamin D deficiency. This includes people who spend significant amounts of time indoors, such as the elderly or those with chronic illnesses. Additionally, individuals with darker skin pigmentation produce less vitamin D from sunlight due to increased melanin, which acts as a natural sunscreen. These factors contribute to a greater likelihood of vitamin D deficiency in these populations. ‚ÄúAs we work in AC and travel by car, we should take monthly doses of Vitamin- D to avoid having deficiencies‚Äù, Dr. Manjeeta states. üì£ For more lifestyle news, click here to join our WhatsApp Channel and also follow us on Instagram","category":"lifestyle"},{"publishedAt":"2024-10-22","title":"‚ÄòEclectic‚Äô fashion choices to passion for art, there‚Äôs more to Shalini Passi than meets the eye","description":"Shalini is not just a high-profile art connoisseur, she also works for the welfare and upliftment of underprivileged children.","urlToImage":"https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/10/461661750_18353674864139556_393416178425390477_n.jpg?w=640","content":"Shalini Passi is rarely seen in casual attire, even at home; she‚Äôs known for lounging in couture.

This celebration, apart from being in poor taste, is a crass and a light-hearted mockery of the seriousness of the legal proceedings that are underway against the petitioner who has been accused of a very grave offence,‚Äù it said. The police, which filed a status report on October 19, said though the investigation was at an initial stage, there was a ‚Äústockpile of evidence‚Äù against him. Emphasising the need for Siddique‚Äôs custodial interrogation, Kerala police said it was essential to expose his ‚Äúlie of righteousness before he goes down in history as a hero and gets venerated by subsequent generations as worthy of emulation‚Äù. On September 30, the top court granted him interim protection from arrest in the case and directed him to cooperate in the investigation. The police said the actor, who has worked in over 350 Malayalam films, was trying to disrupt the smooth flow of the investigation by ‚Äúworking overtime to weaken the case‚Äù. The affidavit filed by Ajichandran Nair, Assistant Commissioner of Police at Thiruvananthapuram city, said, ‚ÄúThis has severely demoralised and intimidated not only the victim but also other powerless victims in the film industry who were warily waiting to see the outcome of the proceedings of the anticipatory bail hearing as the case is being widely reported upon by the media and attracting much public attention.‚Äù The police further said the witnesses who have boldly come forward after the Justice Hema Commission report, would step back if the interim protection to the accused was indefinitely prolonged. Also Read | After evading Kerala police for a week, actor Siddique, accused of rape, makes public appearance. Watch ‚ÄúThe process (of investigation) is a lengthy one and will provide ample opportunities and time for the accused to meddle with the investigation if his pre-arrest bail is extended indefinitely. It will create a barrier to effective investigation. In light of the complicated investigation involved in the crime that happened eight years ago, and the various layers of the sequence of events that needs to be unearthed as part of investigation, it is essential that the accused is in custody while the crucial investigation and evidence gathering is underway,‚Äù the police said. Considering the influence and clout of the accused some of the evidence will be tampered and witnesses will be threatened, said the police, underlining the actor‚Äôs custodial interrogation was ‚Äúabsolutely necessary‚Äù. ‚ÄúIt is my humble prayer before the court to dismiss his SLP as the brutality of the accused crossed all limits. It is hence imperative that he should be unmasked,‚Äù stated the report. The police said that the willingness of Siddique to cooperate has been limited to merely appearing before the special investigation team, after the interim protection was granted by the apex court. The actor was accused of not cooperating with the police, which stressed his custody was essential to unearth the sequence of events and recovery of the digital devices used to contact the survivor. Pointing out that Siddique was an extremely influential person in society, the police said he had ability to obstruct the course of justice and scuttle the investigative machinery. It added that following the dismissal of the bail application by the Kerala High Court on September 23, Siddique immediately went absconding like a common criminal, evading arrest and escaping the clutches of law. ‚ÄúHe re-surfaced only after a week once the Supreme Court granted the interim protection. All this highlights the unwillingness of the accused to cooperate with the investigating agency, and also bide time to destroy evidence and turn circumstances in his favour,‚Äù the police said.

Across the highway is a village situated on the foothills of a mountain with dense forests. The victims were employees of infrastructure company APCO Infratech, which is constructing the Z-Morh tunnel on the Srinagar-Sonamarg highway.

Among the moves in the works are changes to the Aircraft Security Rules‚Äîwhich would allow culprits to be banned from flying‚Äîand amendments to the Suppression of Unlawful Acts against Safety of Civil Aviation (SUASCA) Act, 1982, Civil Aviation Minister K Rammohan Naidu said Monday. Indian airlines have been hit by a spate of bomb hoaxes over the past week, with nearly 100 confirmed cases of fake bomb threats coming their way, mostly from anonymous and unverified social media accounts. The threats have sent the airlines, airports, and security agencies into a tizzy, and have forced a few flight diversions and strict post-landing security checks and screenings in a number of cases. ‚ÄúThere has to be some kind of deterrent. That deterrent, we feel, through this legislative action we can bring through,‚Äù Naidu told reporters. On being asked if the investigations into these bomb hoaxes point to any conspiracy, the minister said it would not be appropriate to comment till the investigations are on. The first measure‚Äîchanges to the Aircraft Security Rules‚Äîwould enable inclusion of those behind hoax bomb threats to the no-fly list, which essentially would ban them from flying on Indian carriers‚Äô flights. Currently, the no-fly list is maintained only for unruly passengers, including anyone making a bomb threat while on board. However, it does not cover those sending bomb threats from outside through calls, social media, and emails, among others. According to Naidu, the SUASCA Act currently applies mostly to acts of violence or intent to cause violence while the aircraft is operating. MoCA wants the law‚Äôs ambit to be expanded in order to deal with bomb threats even when an aircraft is on ground and not operating a flight, and make it a cognizable offence under the Act. Naidu said that inter-ministerial consultations would be underway soon as MoCA wants the amendments to take effect at the earliest. Apart from a jail term, the offence is likely to also attract a hefty fine, Naidu said, adding that the details would be subject to the inter-ministerial discussions. Currently, such hoax bomb threats are dealt with in accordance with the country‚Äôs criminal laws, as there are no legal provisions dealing specifically with bomb threats to aircraft. Although most bomb threats turn out to be fake, airlines as well as aviation authorities globally take them with utmost seriousness. The security checks, which often take a few hours, result in disruptions like delays and even rescheduling of the remainder of the flight in some cases, which hit the airlines financially. When an aircraft receives a bomb threat deemed as a specific threat, a detailed security protocol is followed which could include diverting the aircraft to a suitable nearby airport and taking it to an isolated bay, where passengers are quickly made to deplane. The aircraft as well as passengers‚Äô bags are subject to a thorough security inspection before being allowed to take off again. After the screening and security checks, if the threat is found to be a hoax, the aircraft is released for operations. The relevant government ministries‚Äîincluding the Ministry of Civil Aviation (MoCA) and the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA)‚Äîand agencies have gone into a huddle in view of these bomb threats. Naidu said that his ministry, the Bureau of Civil Aviation Security (BCAS), and the MHA and its agencies are working in close coordination to deal with the spate of threats. According to Naidu, security has been enhanced at airports in view of the threats, with the number of security checks at various checkpoints being increased by 10 per cent. Close circuit television camera coverage has also been enhanced at airports, wherever the need was felt. This is being done to be doubly sure that no suspected articles are carried on board the aircraft. The minister said that the government‚Äôs effort is to ensure that all necessary security protocols are followed when bomb threats are received, while also trying to minimise passenger inconvenience and disruptions to airline operations. In a bulk of the cases, the social media accounts that posted the threats were set up only recently, and were suspended by X (formerly Twitter) after the threats. In fact, in some cases, the threats were issued for flights that had already been operated for the day or were not scheduled to operate, suggesting that they were fake. On being asked if the government and the agencies are now becoming more selective in marking such anonymous threats as specific threats‚Äîwhich triggers a detailed security protocol and could lead to disruptions, diversions, and delays‚ÄîNaidu said that while all requisite norms are being followed, the BCAS and the airport-specific Bomb Threat Assessment Committees (BTACs)‚Äîwhich assess the threat and decide the course of action‚Äîare keeping the process ‚Äúdynamic‚Äù based on the learnings in recent cases. ‚ÄúThey have been coming up with different processes so that it gets a little easier to address these kinds of situations from our side, not to say that we are easing down the whole process of assessing‚Ä¶We are keeping it very dynamic. We are not keeping ourselves rigid in terms of the guidelines and are assessing and learning from what has been happening. The BCAS also has been innovative in their approach, and this is in thorough consultation and coordination with all the necessary agencies, be it the MHA or airport level security officers,‚Äù Naidu said, adding that all threats are being assessed on a case-by-case basis. According to sources in the government, efforts are on to trace and nab the individuals or groups behind these anonymous accounts. However, the use of virtual private networks (VPNs) by those positing the threats has made it challenging for the agencies. Government agencies are learnt to be in contact with social media platforms and VPN service providers to trace these threats.","category":"india"},{"publishedAt":"2024-10-22","title":"On J&K terror attack, Farooq Abdullah says Kashmir won‚Äôt become Pakistan; ‚ÄòIslam deplores such behaviour,‚Äô says Mirwaiz","description":"In the first militant attack on a key infrastructure company in Jammu and Kashmir, at least seven people, including a doctor, were killed.","urlToImage":"https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/10/farooq-abdullah.jpg?w=640","content":"Condemning the attack that killed seven employees of a construction company in J&K‚Äôs Ganderbal district, National Conference president Farooq Abdullah said ‚ÄúKashmir will not become Pakistan‚Äù.

Developed by the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI), UPI is an instant real-time payment system for facilitating inter-bank transactions through mobile phones. Muizzu on Sunday set up a consortium to introduce UPI in the country and appointed TradeNet Maldives Corporation Limited as its leading agency, according to a press release by the President‚Äôs Office. The president also suggested the participation of the country‚Äôs banks, telecom companies, state-owned companies and fintech companies in the consortium. He ‚Äúdecided to take the necessary steps‚Äù on the recommendation of the Cabinet, the press release said. ‚ÄúThis move is expected to bring significant benefits to the Maldivian economy, including increased financial inclusion, improved efficiency in financial transactions, and enhanced digital infrastructure,‚Äù it said. Muizzu also constituted an inter-agency coordination team comprising the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Homeland Security and Technology and the country‚Äôs Monetary Authority to lead the Ministry of Economic Development and Trade in overseeing the establishment of the UPI in the Maldives. The agreement to introduce UPI in Maldives was signed during External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar‚Äôs three-day official visit to the country in August. Earlier this month, dollar-starved Maldives floated a new foreign currency regulation, limiting types of transactions allowed in foreign currency and imposing mandatory foreign currency exchange controls on tourism establishments and banks. The Maldivian economy appears to have taken a hit after calls to Indian tourists to avoid the picturesque island nation as a response to President Muizzu‚Äôs ‚ÄòIndia Out‚Äô campaign last year. Muizzu won the presidential election last year on an ‚ÄòIndia out‚Äô campaign and asked New Delhi to withdraw its military personnel posted in the archipelago nation by May this year. However, Muizzu has since toned down his anti-India stance and visited India on his first state visit to the country earlier this month. Tourism is the main source of economic activity for the Maldives, contributing nearly 30 per cent of the GDP and generating more than 60 per cent of foreign exchange.","category":"india"},{"publishedAt":"2024-10-22","title":"Kashmir terror attack: Pakistan still trying to kill innocent people to disrupt peace, says LG","description":"On Sunday, a doctor from Kashmir and six non-local labourers were killed while five people sustained injuries in the terror attack at an under-construction tunnel at Gund in Ganderbal district.","urlToImage":"https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/10/sinha.png?w=640","content":"A day after seven persons were killed in a terror attack in Ganderbal, Lieutenant Governor Manoj Sinha on Monday said Pakistan was still trying to kill innocent people and disrupt peace in Jammu and Kashmir.

Yes, we do. That‚Äôs my national interest. That‚Äôs my core concern with Canada, which is trying to tear up Indian territory.‚Äù Canada‚Äôs Acting High Commissioner to India Stewart Ross Wheeler outside the MEA in New Delhi. (PTI/File) Asked if anything illegal was done, Verma said, ‚ÄúIt is all overt. There‚Äôs nothing covert. It‚Äôs all overt. So we read the newspapers, we read their statements since we understand Punjabi, so we read their social media posts, and try to infer from there.‚Äù Asked whether the Government of India has ever been involved in targeting any of these individuals, he said, ‚ÄúNever, with full responsibility.‚Äù On whether he condemned Nijjar‚Äôs murder, he said, ‚ÄúAny murder is wrong and bad. I do condemn‚Ä¶ Let‚Äôs get to the bottom of the issue. But to get to the bottom of the issue, there has to be evidence shared that you have, and we will share our evidence. Don‚Äôt we do that in extradition cases?‚Äù Asked about extrajudicial murders, he said, ‚ÄúIt should not happen anywhere in the world. I know the countries which have done it, and some of them are G7 countries. By the way, let‚Äôs not talk about it. There should not be double standards. So, as far as we are concerned, the largest democracy in the world, we are committed not to do extrajudicial killings on any territory.‚Äù ExplainedSignals not end of tiesThe outgoing Indian High Commissioner has targeted Prime Minister Trudeau, the Canadian police and accused Canadian intelligence of using Khalistan separatists as assets. But like the Canadian envoy, he maintained that people-to-people and business ties should not be impacted. On the US indictment in the alleged plot against pro-Khalistan figure Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, he said, ‚ÄúSo indictment is not a conviction‚Ä¶ It will follow its judicial process, and we are fine with that, so much so that we ourselves formed a committee, a high-level committee, to help the Americans in this. I will not be able to talk much about it, because my mandate is India-Canada relations and not India-US relations.‚Äù On the connection between the two plots, Verma said, ‚ÄúI entirely refute this connection due to various reasons‚Ä¶ Canada didn‚Äôt follow the practice, which should have been there, evidence should have been shared first. But someone decided to stand in parliament and talk about a thing for which he (referring to Trudeau) himself has said there was no evidence. So, let‚Äôs be very clear what we are talking about. And the day on which he did that, since then, he has made sure that bilateral relations with India only goes downwards, spiralling down.‚Äù About the RCMP being politically independent, he said, ‚ÄúHow politically independent they are‚Ä¶ we can discuss it till the cows come home ‚Ä¶ So till two days before, they said there is no evidence to share‚Ä¶ and all of a sudden, there is other evidence in the world available with them. So let‚Äôs not go there. And the political motivation. I have been talking about it for a long time. No institution can remain completely aloof from what‚Äôs happening politically.‚Äù On Trudeau‚Äôs charge, Verma said, ‚ÄúOn the basis of intelligence, if you want to destroy a relationship, be my guest.‚Äù On the people linked to murder cases, he said, ‚ÄúSome of them came here as innocent international students, and they turned into criminals in this country. I don‚Äôt know what happened. How did they get influenced? I have no information on that.‚Äù ‚ÄúWhat they call this evidence is hearsay, and I know for sure that they go from one person to the other asking them about the hearsay. Most of them are those who are pro-Khalistan elements, anti-India elements, anti India-Canada elements, and then they take that as evidence,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúLargely given the mistrust that we have on Mr. Trudeau and his team, we will have concerns and discuss it very carefully with them. Our security and safety are concerns‚Ä¶ Khalistani extremists are being encouraged all the time. This is my allegation. I am not giving any evidence of that. I also know that some of these Khalistan extremists are deep assets of CSIS (Canadian Security Intelligence Service).‚Äù On whether Indian and Canadian diplomats will be replaced and the impact this will have on bilateral ties, Verma said, ‚ÄúIt is a matter of conversation between the two governments. As far as the relationship itself is concerned, it is a large relationship. Canada had been a friend of India. Canada will remain a friend of India. There have been issues between two countries that many countries have. That‚Äôs not a surprise. We only want the Canadian regime of the day, the government of the day, to understand my core concerns and try to act on that sincerely, rather than for those who are trying to challenge Indian sovereignty and territorial integrity.‚Äù ‚ÄúThe largest Sikh population in the world is in India. They undergo elections at least every five years. Their election voting percentage is much higher than any time of Canadian elections‚Ä¶ What happens to India will be decided by Indians. These Khalistani terrorists and extremists who are based out of Canada are not Indians. They are Canadian citizens, and no government should encourage their citizens to attack sovereignty and territorial integrity,‚Äù he said.

In the quarter ended June 2024, the real GDP growth slipped to a five-quarter low of 6.7 per cent due to slower growth in agriculture, government spending and services. ‚ÄúIn spite of recent geopolitical tensions, India‚Äôs growth outlook is supported by robust domestic engines,‚Äù the ‚ÄòState of the Economy‚Äô article published in the RBI‚Äôs October bulletin said. The article has been prepared by the RBI‚Äôs Deputy Governor Michael Patra and other central bank officials. The RBI said the views published in the article are of the authors and not of the institution. Some high frequency indicators have, however, shown a slackening of momentum in the second quarter of 2024-25. This is partly attributable to idiosyncratic factors like unusually heavy rains in August and September, and Pitru Paksha7 ‚Äì goods and services tax (GST) collections; automobile sales; bank credit growth; merchandise exports; and the manufacturing purchasing managers‚Äô index (PMI). In parallel, there are other high frequency indicators which show steady growth, the article said ‚ÄúIn India, aggregate demand is poised to shrug off the temporary slowdown in momentum in the second quarter of 2024-25 as festival demand picks up pace and consumer confidence improves,‚Äù it said. Rural demand is expected to get a boost from the improved agricultural outlook. The article said that private investment should pick up steam in response to signs of pick-up in consumption demand and rising business optimism. It said corporate results for the first quarter of 2024-25 had shown a deceleration in real gross value added by non-government non-finance companies. Real investments in plants and machinery remained subdued while net fixed assets have slowed down. Apparently, the crowding in effect of government capex is lagged. Given the moderation in sales growth, corporates appear to be protecting margins by conserving spending on both raw materials and manpower while delaying an aggressive capex push, the article said. There is a view gaining ground that the time for private investment is now; delay risks loss of competitiveness. ‚ÄúThe stage is set for the private sector to deploy capital and invest in growth, build capacities, create employment and improve efficiencies,‚Äù the article stated. It further said that with the financial sector ready to intermediate resources for productive investment, buffered by healthy balance sheets, and the government‚Äôs continued thrust on capex, the investment outlook appears bright. ‚ÄúThe ongoing strengthening of global trade could provide fillip to external demand for India‚Äôs exports although escalation of geopolitical tensions remains a potential threat,‚Äù the article said. As per the World Trade Organization (WTO) goods trade barometer (September 2024), global goods trade has continued to recover in the third quarter of 2024 despite headwinds. The RBI‚Äôs article said that in terms of aggregate supply, above normal rainfall in the monsoon season augurs well for overall kharif production in the country as well as for reservoir storage, which brightens the Rabi season outlook. The increased likelihood of La Ni√±a conditions developing during the post-monsoon season of 2024 is beneficial for overall precipitation, although the possibility of excessive rainfall damaging the standing kharif crops remains a risk. It said that the country‚Äôs external sector is showing resilience despite rising geopolitical tensions.

At the same time, a sustained capital-market performance could accelerate the shift of retail savings to investments (in the stock markets), the report said. The recent sharp rise in the loan-to-deposit ratio (LDR) could become a structural issue if low returns on deposits amid inflationary pressures ‚Äì and evolving depositor preferences ‚Äì hinder long-term deposit growth, the rating firm said. ‚ÄúWe expect the share of borrowings will continue to rise gradually within the overall funding mix, from its current 10 per cent, if the banks fail to attract sufficient low-cost long-term resources to finance loan growth,‚Äù Fitch said. Bank deposit rates have been slow to respond to the sharp 250 bps increase in policy rates during the financial year ended March 2023 (FY23), with term deposit rates to fully reflect this change as of Q1 of FY25. The return on low-cost deposits remains unchanged, leading to their share in new deposits hitting a two-decade low of 20 per cent in FY24, according to Fitch‚Äôs estimate. This could put pressure on funding costs over the medium term. Low-cost deposits‚Äô migration to term deposits is usual under high interest rates, but the former‚Äôs share in fresh deposits fell to 20 per cent in the financial year ended March 2024 (FY24), a two-decade low, it said. ‚ÄúFactors such as inflationary pressures, increasing digitalisation, and strong capital-market performance may further drive depositors to shift from bank deposits towards investments,‚Äù Fitch said. This trend poses a risk to funding costs, and could render asset-liability management more challenging if banks‚Äô long-term funding does not plug the gap from any migrating deposits, it said. Fitch does not expect any near-term rating changes due to adequate headroom in Viability Ratings, but significant funding changes that intensify margin pressure beyond Fitch‚Äôs base case ‚Äì or have an impact on banks‚Äô growth and liquidity management ‚Äì may necessitate reassessment of individual key rating factor scores, the rating firm said. Term deposit rates have risen by only 234 bps since March 2022, while low-cost deposits rates remain unchanged. ‚ÄúThere is a risk that the recent sharp rise in the loan-to-deposit ratio (LDR) may persist as a structural issue if future deposit growth is constrained ‚Äì due to low/negative real return on deposits and evolving depositor preferences amid inflationary pressures, and high loan growth,‚Äù Fitch said. Deposit growth matched loan growth at a 9.4 per cent CAGR between FY14-FY24, but LDR has risen by 10 percentage points since FY21. Normalisation of previous liquidity excesses necessitates that banks focus on growing deposits, Fitch said. Fitch considers banks‚Äô current deposit pricing strategy unsustainable over the long term, if deposits must support the economy‚Äôs high reliance on bank credit. Meanwhile, mutual fund (MF) investments have grown by a 24 per cent CAGR since FY17. Sustained capital-market performance could accelerate the shift of retail savings to investments. Demographic shifts and digitisation may also spur the move away from bank deposits, the rating firm said. ‚ÄúA continued sharp rise in the LDR could intensify margin pressure beyond Fitch‚Äôs expectations. Indian banks have limited pricing power, which may prevent full pass-through of increased funding costs without additional risk-taking.‚Äù Fitch said sustained easing of the Reserve Bank of India‚Äôs liquidity stance, or higher government-linked inflows, could ease pressure, as in the past, but declining flows due to lower real return on deposits could raise pressure on LDR and asset/liability management. A widening of the depositor base from the top 15 urban centres ‚Äì 65 per cent of MF assets, 44 per cent of bank deposits ‚Äì could augment inflows and support banks‚Äô deposit retention.","category":"business"},{"publishedAt":"2024-10-22","title":"Waaree Energies IPO sees 3.3x subscription on day 1, demand from non-institutional investors high","description":"The IPO, which closes on October 23 and is set to list on the stock exchanges on October 28, comprises over 2.8 crore shares with a price band of Rs 1,427 to Rs 1,503 per equity share.","urlToImage":"https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/10/ch1692962.jpeg?w=640","content":"Waaree Energies Ltd, India‚Äôs largest solar photovoltaic (PV) module manufacturer, launched its Rs 4,321 crore initial public offering (IPO) Monday, which was subscribed 3.3 times on the first day itself.

Shares reserved for non-institutional investors were subscribed 8 times while the retail investor category was booked 3.2 times, as per NSE data.

In comparison, two Adani Enterprises Ltd subsidiaries involved in this sector made a little over Rs 8,000 crore together, while Premier Energies and Vikram Solar made around Rs 3,100 crore and Rs 2,500 crore each. Tata Power Ltd‚Äôs module manufacturer TP Solar Ltd made only Rs 230 crore. Over the years, revenues and margins for all companies in the sector have increased considerably. Waaree‚Äôs EBITDA margins in FY24 stood at 15.6 per cent in FY24, compared to 6.9 per cent in FY22, when revenue was just Rs 2,800 crore. Waaree‚Äôs growth has been driven by strong exports, primarily to the US. In FY24, 58 per cent of its sales were from exports compared to 23 per cent in FY22. Waaree and Adani together account for a large majority of module exports from India. Significantly, 1.6 GW of its 3 GW facility in Texas is set to become operational by the end of FY25, further boosting its presence in the U.S. market. Reliance on China and PLI push India‚Äôs $8-billion solar module market has grown to nearly 60 GW in domestic module assembly capacity and 8 GW in cell production capacity. Still, most module assemblers continue to rely on imported cells from China, which currently has over 80 per cent of the global market share in the solar module supply chain. In addition to the government‚Äôs Rs 24,000 crore Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme for integrated module manufacturing, the sector is now turning to public equity investors to expand capacity and secure supply chains for both domestic and export markets, as countries globally face mounting pressure to counter the threat of module dumping by Chinese manufacturers. Waaree, for instance, plans to use Rs 2,775 crore from its IPO to finance a 6 GW wafer-to-module facility in Odisha. Premier Energies also plans to use its IPO proceeds to partly finance a 4 GW cell-to-module facility in Hyderabad. A significant amount of integrated solar module capacity is set to come online this financial year, including Waaree‚Äôs 5.4 GW cell facility.

Though the division is being framed as a battle of billionaires, the reality is that it is infeasible for any single country to auction satellite spectrum, given its very nature. Unlike terrestrial spectrum which is used for mobile communications, satellite spectrum has no national territorial limits and is international in character. It is therefore coordinated and managed by the UN agency, International Telecommunications Union (ITU). The Telecommunications Act, 2023, has added spectrum for satellite communication in the list of administrative allocation. The Department of Telecommunication (DoT) had later asked the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) to come up with a methodology to assign the spectrum. Also Read | Satellite spectrum, a high stakes game With TRAI exploring pricing models for the service, Jio wrote to the regulator making a case for auction of satellite spectrum. Their essential argument is that administrative allocation may not be able to bring about a level playing field between satellite and terrestrial services. Musk, however, responded to the submissions, saying: ‚Äú‚ÄúThat would be unprecedented, as this spectrum was long designated by the ITU as a shared spectrum for satellites‚Äù. With Telecom Minister Jyotiraditya Scindia saying India will follow the global norm by allocating satellite spectrum, here‚Äôs a low down on what the service is and how countries have tried auctioning the airwaves to no avail: What is satellite communication, and what benefits does it offer to end-users? Satellite communication services rely on an array of satellites in orbit to offer connectivity to homes and businesses on the ground. They are an alternative to ground based communication, called terrestrial networks, such as cable, fibre, or digital subscriber line (DSL), and they don‚Äôt require wires to transmit data. For end-users, satellite-based communication and broadband services offer benefits on two key points: wider coverage, and a more resilient network. Even though the latency of satcom services can at times be higher than terrestrial broadband networks, they can cover vast swathes of areas with very little physical equipment needing to be installed. Opinion | Satellite spectrum, a high stakes game Satellites that orbit in space are vital for communication networks to reach the farthest corners even in remote locations that mobile telephony cannot access. Thus, it is generally understood that when satcom services will become more mainstream, a number of low lying areas, rural areas and areas impacted by frequent exigencies could benefit from constant connectivity. Satellite-based internet is also generally believed to be more resilient than terrestrial-based communication services since they have comparatively fewer components on the ground. The equipment for satellite communication is, therefore, less likely to sustain damage during extreme weather and other emergencies. A latest report by KPMG in India, has estimated that India‚Äôs satcom sector, which currently stands at $2.3 billion a year, will reach $20 billion by 2028. At present, the country ranks fourth in terms of investments in the sector, globally. According to Morgan Stanley, there are 290.4 million households in India which are untapped with broadband and that can be a strong market opportunity for satellite operators to tap. How do countries around the world assign satellite spectrum to operators? It is first important to understand the key difference between spectrum for terrestrial networks and satellite communication, and why the distinction between allocation and auctioning arises in the first place. For terrestrial mobile services, the spectrum is exclusive and is managed only by a single mobile operator in a given geographic area; therefore, this cannot be shared between or amongst operators. While in the case of satellites, the same spectrum is non-exclusive in nature and it can be used by multiple satellite operators to serve the same geographic area. The general trend, therefore, is of allocating the spectrum administratively. A few countries, such as the United States of America, Brazil and Saudi Arabia, have conducted auctions for frequency spectrum in the past. The US and Brazil conducted an auction of satellite spectrum along with orbital slots. However, both the countries have since reverted to administrative assignment after finding the process infeasible. The US last conducted an auction for satellite spectrum in 2004 for three domestic orbital slots for broadcasting services. Since then, it has abandoned satellite auctions. In the US, an annual regulatory fee for VSAT and equivalent C-Band antennas operating in the 12 and 14 GHz is $595 per licence or authorisation. In 2020, Brazil amended its regulatory framework to replace satellite auctions with administrative licensing. Though satellite landing rights are assigned through bidding in the country, the spectrum to be used for satellite services is not auctioned separately. Saudi Arabia recently conducted an auction of spectrum in the S-band, which ranges from 2 GHz to 4 GHz and is used for mobile satellite services (MSS) as well as weather and air traffic control applications. However, since the technical characteristics of the S-band are such that it is assigned on an exclusive basis for MSS, auction can be conducted in a manner similar to the spectrum auction for terrestrial mobile services.","category":"business"},{"publishedAt":"2024-10-22","title":"Rupee gains 1 paisa to 84.06 against US dollar in early trade","description":"According to RBI data released on Friday, India's forex reserves declined by USD 10.746 billion to USD 690.43 billion for the week ended October 11.","urlToImage":"https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/08/rupee-falls-1_20240813154115.png?w=640","content":"The rupee showed a recovery from its lower level and gained marginally by 1 paisa to 84.06 against the US dollar in early trade on Monday, tracking positive cues from domestic equity markets and a soft American currency.

The Commerce Ministry is working on developing a fresh Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) aimed at addressing the ‚Äúlack of consistent and streamlined‚Äù procedures for negotiating future trade agreements. This comes after several trade agreements, including the pact with the UAE that came into effect in February 2022 and the one with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) signed way back in 2010, have resulted in significantly higher imports of goods compared to exports, and concerns over potential breaching of rules of origin by the other side. The deal with Australia, which came into effect in December 2022, is yet to deliver substantial export benefits compared to the pre-deal period. The new SOP, designed to serve as a template for negotiation of multilateral and bilateral trade agreements, covers modern chapters in trade deals such as labour and environment, and emphasises the need for a clear understanding of ‚Äútrade-offs‚Äù and ‚Äúeach party‚Äôs bottom line‚Äù. Also Read | India signs trade agreement with EFTA: What is the significance of the deal? It aims to ‚Äústreamline‚Äù the process of launching, conducting and concluding trade negotiations, and addresses issues such as human resource mobilisation, negotiation team formation, and the composition and ‚Äúhierarchy of negotiating teams‚Äù. The ‚Äúguidance document‚Äù,which includes draft templates for studies, reports and terms of reference, also incorporates input from the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) on emerging trends such as ‚Äútwinning‚Äù agreements between state governments and the provincial governments of foreign countries to enhance cooperation in various areas. Additionally, it includes contributions from the Department of Economic Affairs (DEA) and references to inputs made by management consultancy firm Boston Consulting Group. The review of the negotiating strategy comes amid concerns over possible investment outflows, rapidly surging imports from FTA nations, and recognition of errors made when dealing with specific chapters in FTAs. These errors have led to a surge in the inflow of goods that are not even produced in the partner country. Also Read | What Labour election win means for India-UK Free Trade Agreement (FTA) ‚ÄúThe pause in negotiations comes not only due to the widening trade gap but also concerns over the outflow of investment from the country. The focus is shifting to larger markets such as the European Union and the UK, where significant benefits could be gained, and to countries of geopolitical importance, such as the Maldives. However, the problem is the lack of subject matter expertise and loss of institutional memory. Foreign negotiators are battle-hardened with years of expertise in negotiations, unlike in India where officials are rotated periodically,‚Äù an official said. Before the Lok Sabha elections, the government had signed a trade agreement with the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) and was close to signing an agreement with Oman to expand its footprint in the West Asia region. The deal with the UK was also near completion but could not be finalised due to several leadership changes in the UK. The government had also indicated plans to begin talks with the Russia-led Eurasian Economic Union (EEU). But the Ministry could now narrow its efforts to maximise export gains. Notably, while India has been able to manage early harvest deals and negotiate with countries that have accommodated India‚Äôs style of functioning, trade deals with more competitive countries, such as the UK and the EU, have been stalled for years. India had earlier decided to exit from the China-led Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) after years of negotiations. ‚ÄúNegotiations with smaller countries such as Peru, Oman and Chile are paused as there are concerns that the deals we are signing are not providing equivalent benefits. We are opening a large market for the partner country, but there is a sense that we are not receiving commensurate returns,‚Äù another official familiar with the development said. Trade data for September showed that India‚Äôs imports from the UAE surged at their fastest pace compared to any other country. Official data showed that imports increased by a sharp 49.22 per cent in September 2024 compared to the previous year. Meanwhile, exports to the transnational hub only managed a 23.75 per cent rise in September 2024 compared to the previous year. The trend of sharply rising imports and slower export growth has been consistent over the last six months. In the April-September period, imports from the UAE surged by a significant 52 per cent to $31.45 billion compared to $20.69 billion in the same period last year, while exports grew by only 11.45 per cent to $17.23 billion this year compared to $15.46 billion in the previous year. The trade gap between April-September 2024 as against 2023 widened by 171 per cent. Notably, the trade gap had jumped 55 per cent between April-September 2022 compared to 2021. The Commerce and Industry Ministry has also initiated a review of the ASEAN deal, pointing out that it did not produce the expected gains and has led to rising imports. The ASEAN trade deal, signed during the UPA era, has faced significant criticism due to the widening trade deficit, particularly after Covid-19. The trade deficit with the region increased by a sharp 70 per cent in FY23 compared to FY22. The goods trade deficit reached $44 billion in FY23. Officials have stated that India faces tariff asymmetry in the ASEAN agreement and aims to complete the review by next year. Concerns over a fresh surge in imports have also arisen as ASEAN has joined the China-led RCEP trade deal. Trade between China and ASEAN grew by 15 per cent in 2022 after the deal came into effect. India exited the RCEP negotiations in 2019 due to concerns about rising imports from China. ASEAN countries comprise Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam. Timor-Leste or East Timor, which holds observer status, is on track to become its 11th member. The region remains a crucial trading partner for India, accounting for about 11 per cent of the country‚Äôs global trade. Queries emailed Saturday to the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, Ministry of External Affairs, Department of Economic Affairs and Boston Consulting Group remained unanswered.","category":"business"},{"publishedAt":"2024-10-22","title":"Solar imports could soar to $30 billion annually as India targets 2030 renewable goals: GTRI","description":"India has added 15 GW of solar capacity in 2023-24, bringing the total to 90.8 GW by September, a significant increase from just 2.8 GW in 2014.","urlToImage":"https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/10/solar-panel.jpg?w=640","content":"India‚Äôs ambitious goal of installing 500 GW of renewable energy capacity by 2030 may drive the country‚Äôs annual solar equipment imports to around $30 billion due to heavy reliance on Chinese goods, Global Trade Research Initiative (GTRI) has said. The think tank has emphasised on the need for India to develop a self-reliant solar manufacturing ecosystem, particularly in key areas such as polysilicon and wafer production, without which India may continue to face high import costs, jeopardising its ability to meet its renewable energy targets. Earlier this month, The Indian Express had reported that India‚Äôs clean energy manufacturing is experiencing a detrimental impact from Chinese predatory pricing, which is undermining the country‚Äôs efforts to promote domestic manufacturing under the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme. The report said that the US had advised India to ‚Äúexpand and protect‚Äù its clean energy manufacturing sector, with the Indian government already investing over $4.5 billion through the PLI scheme to support this nascent industry. India has added 15 GW of solar capacity in 2023-24, bringing the total to 90.8 GW by September, a significant increase from just 2.8 GW in 2014. However, GTRI estimates that to achieve the 500 GW target by 2030, the country must increase installations to 65-70 GW annually, with solar power expected to account for over 80 per cent of this capacity. ‚ÄúThis target appears highly ambitious, especially considering India‚Äôs dependence on imports, which could push solar imports to $30 billion annually,‚Äù the report stated. The Economic Survey 2023-24 had highlighted that China‚Äôs manufacturing trade surplus has been expanding since 2019 due to weak domestic demand and increasing industrial capacity. The mismatch between domestic supply and demand in China has widened in recent years, prompting Chinese companies to seek additional markets overseas, the survey noted. In 2023-24, India imported solar equipment worth $7 billion, with China supplying 62.6 per cent. China‚Äôs dominance in global solar manufacturing‚Äîcontrolling 97 per cent of polysilicon production and 80 per cent of solar modules‚Äîmakes it challenging for other countries to compete. While India has introduced initiatives like the PLI scheme to boost local manufacturing, GTRI founder Ajay Srivastava pointed out that these efforts have had limited impact, as they continue to rely heavily on imported inputs. The report noted that India‚Äôs solar manufacturing sector is still in its infancy, with most projects dependent on imported, ready-to-use solar modules. In the last fiscal year, India imported $4.4 billion worth of these modules, along with solar cells and other key components such as inverters and cables. ‚ÄúNearly 90 per cent of India‚Äôs solar manufacturing involves assembling modules from imported cells, with only 15 per cent local value addition,‚Äù the report said. It added that only a few Indian companies manufacture solar cells at a commercial scale, and none produce solar cells from scratch using domestic materials. To reduce imports, Srivastava emphasised that India needs to invest in the production of solar cells starting from silica refining, which involves costly and energy-intensive processes such as polysilicon production. Srivastava also highlighted the importance of domestic production of key materials like aluminium frames and glass, which will require strong research and development efforts and significant government support. The report stated that China remains India‚Äôs largest supplier of solar equipment, followed by Vietnam, Malaysia, and Thailand. To reduce dependency on China, India has imposed customs duties of 40 per cent on solar modules and 25 per cent on solar cells. However, imports from ASEAN countries are exempt from these duties under the India-ASEAN free trade agreement. GTRI recommended several steps to boost domestic manufacturing, including investments in upstream solar production, expanding the scope of the PLI scheme, and creating a skilled workforce. Srivastava also suggested that India should collaborate with countries like the US, the EU, and Japan to establish large-scale solar manufacturing facilities. The global shift towards renewable energy, led by the US, EU, Japan, and India, heavily relies on solar power, which constitutes a significant portion of the renewable energy mix in most countries. With control over 80 per cent of global solar production, China remains a dominant player, exporting $39.5 billion worth of solar modules in 2023 alone.","category":"business"},{"publishedAt":"2024-10-22","title":"HDFC Bank arm to come out with Rs 12,500 crore IPO","description":"HDFC Bank will offload about Rs 10,000 crore worth stake in the proposed IPO.","urlToImage":"https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/10/hdfc.jpg?w=640","content":"HDB Financial Services (HDBFS), a subsidiary of HDFC Bank, will come out with a Rs 12,500 crore public issue, the bank said in an exchange filing.

Most of the threats received by airlines on Sunday came from an anonymous and unverified account ‚Äî@schizophreniqqq‚Äî on social media platform X, per sources in the know. The account was later suspended by X. On Friday and Saturday, another anonymous X account ‚Äî@adamlanza111‚Äî had posted threats to as many as 46 flights of Indian airlines before being taken down by the social media platform. With the threats received on Sunday, the number of bomb hoaxes received by Indian airlines this week crossed at least 90. These social media accounts appear to have been created only recently, which is usually the case with social media accounts used to issue fake threats. Although most bomb threats turn out to be fake, airlines as well as aviation authorities globally take them with utmost seriousness. The security checks, which often take a few hours, result in disruptions like delays and even rescheduling of the remainder of the flight in some cases, which hit the airlines financially. On Sunday, six flights each of IndiGo, Akasa Air, Vistara, and Air India received the threats, all of which were found to be fake following security checks upon landing, sources indicated. Vistara‚Äôs Delhi-Frankfurt flight UK27 returned to Delhi following the threat. The flight was just about to exit the Pakistani airspace on the way to Frankfurt when it turned around and headed back to Delhi, per flight tracking data. ‚ÄúWe confirm receiving security threats, on social media, for six Vistara flights operating on 20 October 2024. These flights include: Flight UK25 (Delhi to Frankfurt), Flight UK106 (Singapore to Mumbai), Flight UK146 (Bali to Delhi), Flight UK116 (Singapore to Delhi), Flight UK110 (Singapore to Pune), Flight UK107 (Mumbai to Singapore). In line with the protocols, all relevant authorities were immediately notified, and security procedures, as directed by them, are being carried out,‚Äù a Vistara spokesperson said. IndiGo and Akasa Air also confirmed receiving threats via social media for six flights each. Air India did not comment on the issue, but sources indicated that at least six of the airline‚Äôs flights also received threats on Sunday. Air India did not comment on the number of flights affected, but sources indicated that at least six of its flights also received threats on Sunday. ‚ÄúWe confirm that some Air India flights operating on 20 October 2024 were subject to security threats received on social media. Following the laid down protocols, relevant authorities were immediately alerted, and all security procedures strictly adhered to, as per guidance from the regulatory authorities and security agencies,‚Äù an Air India official said. The IndiGo flights that received bomb threats were: 6E87 (Kozhikode-Dammam), 6E11 (Delhi-Istanbul), 6E17 (Mumbai-Istanbul), 6E58 (Jeddah-Mumbai), 6E112 (Goa-Ahmedabad), and 6E133 (Pune-Jodhpur). In similar statements issued for the affected flights, indigo said that all the passengers got off the planes safely and all standard operating procedures (SOPs) were followed in close coordination with the relevant authorities. The Akasa Air flights that received bomb threats on Sunday included QP1102 (Ahmedabad-Mumbai), QP1378 (Delhi-Goa), QP1385 (Mumbai-Bagdogra), QP1406 (Delhi-Hyderabad), QP1519 (Kochi-Mumbai), and QP1526 (Lucknow-Mumbai). After thorough security inspections of the aircraft, they were released for operations, according to the airline. ‚ÄúThe Akasa Air Emergency Response team was immediately activated and initiated all standard operating procedures, including informing regulatory authorities and monitoring the situation in real-time. Captains and crew members of respective flights followed the required emergency procedures, and prescribed safety and security protocols in coordination with the local authorities. The Airport Services teams at all impacted airports coordinated with local authorities to ensure efficient handling of the situation,‚Äù Akasa Air said. According to sources in the government, efforts are on to trace and nab the individuals or groups behind these anonymous accounts. However, the use of virtual private networks (VPNs) by those positing the threats has made it challenging for the agencies. Government agencies are learnt to be in contact with social media platforms and VPN service providers to trace these threats. This spate of bomb threats started on Monday when three international flights of Indian carriers had received hoax bomb threats. All major scheduled Indian carriers have received these bomb threats. One minor from Chhattisgarh was apprehended earlier this week in connection with the bomb threats issued on Monday. However, social media threats have continued and only risen over subsequent days. The relevant government ministries ‚Äîincluding the Ministry of Civil Aviation (MoCA) and the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA)‚Äî and agencies have gone into a huddle in view of these bomb threats. MoCA is understood to be working closely with the Bureau of Civil Aviation Security (BCAS) to formalise an earlier proposal to ban from flying those behind bomb hoaxes. The government is also exploring changes in current rules and legislations to ensure stringent punishment for the culprits. When an aircraft receives a bomb threat deemed as a specific threat, a detailed security protocol is followed which could include diverting the aircraft to a suitable nearby airport and taking it to an isolated bay, where passengers are quickly made to deplane. The aircraft as well as passengers‚Äô bags and the plane‚Äôs cargo are subject to a thorough security screening. After the screening and security checks, if the threat is found to be a hoax, the aircraft is released for operations.","category":"business"},{"publishedAt":"2024-10-22","title":"Bomb threat to Star Airlines flight to Jamnagar a hoax: Police","description":"Jamnagar Superintendent of Police Premsukh Delu told The Indian Express that the airline's headquarters received the bomb threat and not the airport or police.","urlToImage":"https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/10/starairlines.png?w=640","content":"The bomb threat received by Star Airlines for its flight from Bengaluru to Jamnagar on Saturday turned out to be a hoax, said officials.

Landau stated that India possesses all the growth drivers that China had 20 years ago, and that a focus on education would be crucial, as South Korea‚Äôs experience shows that ‚Äúeducation is everything‚Äù. He also noted that India‚Äôs service sector is generating a significant number of positive externalities in the economy. ‚ÄúI think what India has done with the payment system is going to be a model for the rest of the world, or at least the emerging world. Since 1991, India has found the right balance between the private sector and the public sector. However, there are challenges such as poverty and education,‚Äù he said. Professor Landau added that rising global protectionism poses a major challenge to economic growth for developing countries such as India. Even regions like Europe, which were strong advocates of free trade up until a few years ago, are now prioritising the climate agenda, sometimes in a highly ‚Äúrestrictive‚Äù manner. Notably, Indian policymakers have criticised European Union‚Äôs regulations where climate interferes with trade. Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal and Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman have called taxes under Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) and EU deforestation law as an unfair unilateral measure that could disrupt trade. ‚ÄúI started my career as a trade official 20 years ago. I‚Äôve never been a fanatic for pure free trade. But now, I think it‚Äôs moving in the wrong direction. We may be in the process of ‚Äòthrowing the baby out with the bathwater‚Äô, and that is very dangerous. Much depends on the US election, but depressingly, the one thing on which both parties seem to agree is the trade agenda,‚Äù he said. While former president and Republican nominee Donald Trump has targeted India over high tariffs during his election rallies, President Biden has also announced tariffs on electric vehicles and clean energy products. However, these measures have been largely directed towards China. Under Biden, India and the US resolved all seven pending disputes at the World Trade Organization (WTO). ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think a Democratic US president five years ago would have gone as far as invoking national security. All of this is done under the national security exception of the WTO. I don‚Äôt think a Democratic president would have gone that far. Conceptually, there‚Äôs something worth exploring‚Äîwhat exactly economic security means,‚Äù he said. On China‚Äôs shock and stimulus There were two negative surprises regarding China, compared to expectations 20 years ago when it joined the WTO, the professor said. ‚ÄúWe first thought that we could absorb the China shock. For the US, it was much more concentrated regionally and sectorally than expected, and so the regional implications of the China shock have been enormous. Perhaps that‚Äôs a source of populism. That was certainly the first surprise. The second surprise is that everybody expected that by bringing China into the WTO and the world economic order, they [China] would have supported it. Instead, they fought against it very strongly, and that was a very bad surprise,‚Äù Landau added. Notably, rising imports from China have been a major concern for India, with imports exceeding $100 billion in FY24, affecting businesses from small artisans to large steel manufacturers. During the ongoing financial year, India‚Äôs imports from China have already surpassed $60 billion in the first seven months of 2024‚Äîa 10 per cent increase compared to $55 billion during the same period last year. Landau said that China can grow on its own through size, work, and expertise, but it still needs two things‚Äîcommodities and technology. ‚ÄúIn my view, they have not caught up with the technology frontier where the US is, let alone pushed the frontier beyond the US. And clearly, the US intends to prevent them from doing that. Additionally, the [Chinese] regime, as I see it, is no longer in a position to trigger innovation as much as before,‚Äù he said. When asked if the Chinese stimulus would be enough to revive the Chinese economy, Landau said that while a stimulus makes sense, it may not be sufficient. ‚ÄúWhether it will be enough to dissipate the latent crisis of confidence that exists in China since Covid, I‚Äôm not sure,‚Äù he said. The world‚Äôs second-largest economy is experiencing deflationary pressures due to a sharp decline in the property market and weak consumer confidence. On Saturday, Chinese Finance Minister Lan Foan said the country would issue $325.5 billion in special bonds over the next three months to boost the economy. Interest rates and inflation The professor noted that Western countries have managed to reduce inflation in record time, following the substantial stimulus provided during the Covid-19 pandemic. Notably, inflation in the West has impacted Indian exports, particularly in labour-intensive sectors such as textiles and gems and jewellery. Meanwhile, high inflation has also slowed the flow of investments into developing countries like India. ‚ÄúWhat has been done in the last two years is historically exceptional. Western countries have managed to bring inflation down very close to their target. We are not quite there yet, but we are very close‚Äîin the Euro area, we are almost touching the target, but we are also triggering a recession. To the best of my knowledge, this hasn‚Äôt happened in the last half-century,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIf you look at real interest rates, before the cuts and even after, they are very high right now. Real rates are in the order of 2-2.5 per cent, which for advanced economies is certainly above what we call the famous R-star, the natural equilibrium rate. From that perspective, I wouldn‚Äôt judge the [interest rate] cuts as premature, but everyone is aware that the last mile is more difficult. You don‚Äôt want to remove accommodation too fast, especially since we are still above target,‚Äù he said. Landau said that capital is much scarcer today than it has been over the last two to three decades, with global savings rates falling. ‚ÄúWe have reached unprecedented levels of indebtedness in advanced economies. We have no idea how this will develop. It may continue as usual, or we may face shocks we cannot yet imagine. Climate finance will be difficult.

Separately, the Group of Ministers (GoM) on rate rationalisation also discussed Saturday a GST rejig for several items and proposed cutting rates for some items such as packaged water above 20 litres (5 per cent from 18 per cent), bicycles priced less than Rs 10,000 (5 per cent from 12 per cent) and exercise notebooks (5 per cent from 12 per cent. Shoes above Rs 15,000 and wrist watches above Rs 25,000 are likely to be shifted to the topmost slab of 28 per cent GST from 18 per cent now, a state finance minister said. This rate rejig exercise will help the states and Centre to realise revenue gain of Rs 22,000 crore, which will help cover the revenue loss from reduction in GST rates for insurance premiums and other items, the minister said. For the insurance sector, GST on term life insurance premiums are likely to be exempted for all persons, including plans that consist of family members. Health insurance premium paid by senior citizens irrespective of coverage would also be exempted. For other citizens, health insurance cover till Rs 5 lakh is likely to be exempted and the existing rate of 18 per cent will be charged for health insurance cover over Rs 5 lakh. ‚ÄúEvery GoM member wants to give relief to people. Special focus is on senior citizens. We will submit a report to the Council. Work is being done to reduce the GST rate from 18 per cent, exemption will be given for certain categories (of insurance premium). The final decision will be taken by the GST Council,‚Äù Bihar Deputy Chief Minister Samrat Choudhary, who is the convenor of both the GoMs on insurance and rate rationalisation, said after the two meetings. In its 54th meeting held on September 9, the GST Council had broadly converged on the need to reduce the tax rate for health and life insurance premiums from 18 per cent but the specific proposal was referred to the GoM on life and health insurance premium for further discussion. The existing six-member GoM on rate rationalisation was expanded to form a 13-member GoM on life and health insurance premium with the mandate to submit their report by October-end. The GST Council will meet in November to take a final decision on the rate recommendations by both the GoMs. ‚ÄúThere were discussions held in the meeting. Most states are on board for exempting term life insurance premium from GST. Term life insurance plans which include family members are also going to be exempt. For health insurance, total relief would be given for insurance premiums paid by senior citizens and exemption would be given for health insurance cover up to Rs 5 lakh for others. The existing 18 per cent GST rate will be retained for health insurance cover above Rs 5 lakh,‚Äù a state finance minister, who is a member of the GoM, said after the meeting on Saturday. The revenue implication of the exemption proposal for senior citizens for health insurance is expected to be around Rs 2,200 crore and Rs 200 crore for exemption to term cover premiums. The revenue loss is going to be offset by gains of around Rs 22,000 crore from the proposed hike in rates on several high-end items, sources said. Rate rationalisation was discussed in the second meeting of the GoM that included rate changes for several common-use items such as packaged water, bicycles and exercise notebooks. The broad consensus was to provide relief on consumer goods and charge a higher rate for items with premium value. The GoM has proposed a reduction in the GST rate for packaged drinking water bottles above 20 litre to 5 per cent instead of 18 per cent at present. Bicycles costing less than Rs 10,000 are likely to be charged 5 per cent GST as against 12 per cent at present, whereas GST on exercise books may get reduced to 5 per cent from 12 per cent. The GoM on rate rationalisation will continue to discuss proposals for rate rejig including merger of slabs, another state finance minister said. ‚ÄúRate rationalisation is an ongoing process. Several items of common use have been discussed. More discussions are pending, especially for demerit goods in the 28 per cent slab and for items which were reduced earlier from the 28 per cent slab to 18 per cent or 12 per cent,‚Äù the minister said. In December 2018, the GST Council had reduced rates for several items in the 28 per cent slab including movie tickets priced above Rs 100, television screens and monitors up to 32 inches, digital cameras, video games consoles and power banks with lithium-ion batteries. Items such as dishwashing machines, pan masala, cigarettes, air conditioners, cars, and aircrafts for personal use continue to be in the 28 per cent slab. The decision to reduce GST on insurance premiums has come after several Opposition leaders raised the issue of high tax on premiums. Opposition leaders including Leader of Opposition in Lok Sabha Rahul Gandhi, Trinamool Congress chief Mamata Banerjee have demanded withdrawal of GST on life and health insurance premiums. Banerjee had also written a letter to Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman for rollback of GST on life insurance and health insurance premiums. Earlier on July 28, Union Minister of Road Transport and Highways Nitin Gadkari wrote to Finance Minister Sitharaman, saying GST on life and medical insurance premiums amounted to taxing the ‚Äúuncertainties of life‚Äù. Sitharaman had said in August that tax was levied on insurance premiums even before the imposition of GST and that GST revenues are shared between states and the Centre. In 2023-24, the Centre and states had collected Rs 8,262.94 crore through GST on health insurance premiums, while Rs 1,484.36 crore was collected on account of GST on health reinsurance premiums.","category":"business"},{"publishedAt":"2024-10-22","title":"More bomb threats: 46 flights targeted by same X account","description":"On Saturday, the account has so far posted bomb threats for 34 flights of Indian carriers, and has even started posting threats to overseas airlines like American Airlines, JetBlue, and Air New Zealand.","urlToImage":"https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/10/airlines_5639d8.jpg?w=640","content":"An anonymous and unverified account on social media platform X has gone on a bomb threat spree, threatening over 45 flights of Indian airlines since Friday night and sending airlines, airports, and the aviation security apparatus into a tizzy. The account‚Äî@adamlanza111‚Äîposted bomb threats to 12 flights on Friday night. On Saturday, the account has so far posted bomb threats for 34 flights of Indian carriers, and has even started posting threats to overseas airlines like American Airlines, JetBlue, and Air New Zealand. The account, which was active till Saturday afternoon, has now been suspended by X. It appeared to have been created recently, which is usually the case with social media accounts used to issue fake threats. Although most bomb threats turn out to be fake, airlines as well as aviation authorities globally take them with utmost seriousness. The security checks, which often take a few hours, result in disruptions like delays and even rescheduling of the remainder of the flight in some cases, which hit the airlines financially. The Indian carriers that received bomb threats from this account on Saturday include ‚Äî Air India, Vistara, IndiGo, Akasa Air, SpiceJet, Alliance Air, and Star Air. All these carriers received threats for five flights each, with the exception of Star Air, which received threats for four flights. A few of these flights that were in operation when the threat was received, declared a general emergency. All posts from this account include five flight numbers of the airline being threatened, with an identical message: ‚ÄúThere are bombs placed onboard of 5 your planes‚Ä¶No one will make out alive. Hurry up and evacuate the plane.‚Äù Notably, while some of these flights were airborne when the threats were posted, a few had already been operated. With these incidents, the number of confirmed instances of bomb threats to Indian carriers‚Äô flights this week has risen to around 70. While security protocols would be underway for the flights that received the threats today, all the previous threats this week‚Äîposted from different anonymous social media accounts‚Äîhave turned out to be fake. According to sources in the government, efforts are on to trace and nab the individuals or groups behind these anonymous accounts. However, the use of virtual private networks (VPNs) by those positing the threats has made it challenging for the agencies. Government agencies are learnt to be in contact with social media platforms and VPN service providers to trace these threats. Meanwhile, on Saturday evening, the top brass of BCAS held a meeting with representatives of airlines. The agency emphasised that airlines must continue to follow the stringent standard operating procedures (SOPs) pertaining to security, and also aim to minimise passenger inconvenience while dealing with bomb threats, per sources. This spate of bomb threats started on Monday when three international flights of Indian carriers had received hoax bomb threats. Another ten flights had received threats on Tuesday, while on Wednesday, there were at least seven threats. All major scheduled Indian carriers have received these bomb threats. One minor from Chhattisgarh was apprehended earlier this week in connection with the bomb threats issued on Monday. However, social media threats have continued and only risen over subsequent days. The relevant government ministries‚Äîincluding the Ministry of Civil Aviation (MoCA) and the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA)‚Äîand agencies have gone into a huddle in view of these bomb threats. MoCA is understood to be working closely with the Bureau of Civil Aviation Security (BCAS) to formalise an earlier proposal of putting the perpetrators of hoax bomb threats on the no-fly list. The government is also considering changes in current rules and legislations to ensure stringent punishment for the culprits of fake bomb threats. When an aircraft receives a bomb threat deemed as a specific threat, a detailed security protocol is followed which could include diverting the aircraft to a suitable nearby airport and taking it to an isolated bay, where passengers are quickly made to deplane. The aircraft as well as passengers‚Äô bags and the plane‚Äôs cargo are subject to a thorough security screening. After the screening and security checks, if the threat is found to be a hoax, the aircraft is released for operations.","category":"business"},{"publishedAt":"2024-10-22","title":"How solar module producers are taking the IPO route to fuel expansion, counter Chinese dominance","description":"Waaree Energies, India‚Äôs largest player in the sector, to launch IPO on Monday","urlToImage":"https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/10/Solar.jpg?w=640","content":"As Mumbai-based Waaree Energies Ltd, India‚Äôs largest solar photovoltaic (PV) module manufacturer, prepares to launch its initial public offering (IPO) next week, it becomes the latest player in the sector to tap into the equity market to fund capacity expansion and backward integration amid concerns around overcapacity in China and tightening of trade rules. India‚Äôs $8-billion solar module market has grown to nearly 60 GW in domestic module assembly capacity and 8 GW in cell production capacity. Still, most module assemblers continue to rely on imported cells from China, which currently has over 80 per cent of the global market share in the solar module supply chain. In addition to the government‚Äôs Rs 24,000 crore Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme for integrated module manufacturing, the sector is now turning to public equity investors to expand capacity and secure supply chains for both domestic and export markets, as countries globally face mounting pressure to counter the threat of module dumping by Chinese manufacturers. Waaree‚Äôs Rs 4,300-crore IPO launch on Monday follows Hyderabad-based Premier Energies Ltd‚Äôs public issue of Rs 2,830 crore in August. Last month, Gurugram-based Vikram Solar Ltd also filed its draft red herring prospectus (DRHP) with the market regulator for a Rs 1,500 crore offering. Also Read | Fifth Edition of World Trade Expo promotes green energy, partnerships with developing countries Other players like Gautam Solar Pvt Ltd and Goldi Solar Pvt Ltd have also announced plans for IPOs, while other major module manufacturers operate as subsidiaries of listed companies, namely Adani Enterprises Ltd and Tata Power Ltd. Exports-led growth With 13 GW of assembly capacity, Waaree is India‚Äôs biggest solar module producer and raked in over Rs 11,000 crore in revenue in FY24. In comparison, two Adani subsidiaries involved in this sector made a little over Rs 8,000 crore together, while Premier Energies and Vikram Solar made around Rs 3,100 crore and Rs 2,500 crore each. Tata Power‚Äôs module manufacturer TP Solar Ltd made only Rs 230 crore. Over the years, revenues and margins for all companies in the sector have increased considerably. Waaree‚Äôs EBITDA margins in FY24 stood at 15.6 per cent in FY24, compared to 6.9 per cent in FY22, when revenue was just Rs 2,800 crore. Waaree‚Äôs growth has been driven by strong exports, primarily to the US. In FY24, 58 per cent of its sales were from exports compared to 23 per cent in FY22. Waaree and Adani together account for a large majority of module exports from India. Significantly, 1.6 GW of its 3 GW facility in Texas is set to become operational by the end of FY25, further boosting its presence in the U.S. market. Exports to the US have seen an uptick due to the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act (ULFPA) signed into law by US president Joe Biden in December 2021. The ULFPA blocks import of goods, including modules and cells, produced in China‚Äôs Xinjiang region where forced labour is widespread. ‚ÄúThe US‚Äôs ULFPA, as enforced in June 2022, had increased demand for modules from countries other than China, positioning India as a critical supplier. The US market has become an alternative revenue option for domestic manufacturers, offering a premium over the domestic market, with module prices ranging upwards of $0.25 per watt,‚Äù Sehul Bhatt, a senior analyst at Crisil said. Backward integration is key However, some Indian module exporters, including Waaree, have also seen shipments rejected at US customs over ULFPA violations as they use solar PV cells imported from China. As a long term solution, players are investing in backward integration that includes developing capacities for the entire value chain from wafers to cells to modules. Waaree, for instance, plans to use Rs 2,775 crore from its IPO to finance a 6 GW wafer-to-module facility in Odisha. Premier Energies also plans to use its IPO proceeds to partly finance a 4 GW cell-to-module facility in Hyderabad. A significant amount of integrated solar module capacity is set to come online this financial year, including Waaree‚Äôs 5.4 GW cell facility. Major players like Adani, Tata, and U.S.-based First Solar have already begun cell production, with several now expanding into ancillary goods such as glass and backsheets. The PLI scheme has been crucial in driving this backward integration, though most beneficiaries are yet to claim incentives on sales because of delays in operationalisation. Delays were partly due to restricted access to Chinese technicians caused by visa issues, which have only recently been resolved. Backward integration will help Indian module manufacturers not only reduce reliance on Chinese imports and navigate trade barriers, but also enhance domestic competitiveness and boost profit margins. With the reinstated Approved List of Models and Manufacturers (ALMM) order, which bars the use of imported modules in solar projects, and the ongoing Directorate General of Trade Remedies (DGTR) investigation into Chinese dumping, domestic manufacturers are poised to see significant growth in their order books. ‚ÄòExpansion to help capacity utilisation‚Äô While Waaree‚Äôs capacity utilisation has averaged 43 per cent over the last three financial years, Amit Paithankar, its chief executive officer, said that with capacity expansion, production will get more optimised. ‚ÄúEvery time you have to cater to the needs of a different customer, you end up spending time changing the (production) line to cater to that. And that inhibits you from reaching the full potential of the line. The more changes you have, the worse your capacity utilisation factor gets. So, how does size and scale help in this whole game? The bigger you are, the more easily you can categorise your production and allot a particular set of lines to a specific type of configuration. Then, you start getting much better in terms of productivity and output. The capacity utilisation factor will keep getting better as we move forward. 45 per cent is definitely not the norm, there is a huge headroom,‚Äù Paithankar told The Indian Express. Waaree‚Äôs IPO is set to launch on October 21 and closes on October 23, with a total issue size of over 2.8 crore shares. The price band is set from Rs 1,427 to Rs 1,503 per equity share.","category":"business"},{"publishedAt":"2024-10-22","title":"Over a dozen flights got bomb threats on Friday; Vistara Delhi-London flight diverted to Frankfurt","description":"With these incidents, the number of confirmed instances of bomb threats to Indian carriers‚Äô flights this week has risen to over 45.","urlToImage":"https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/10/vistara_fa0e58.jpg?w=640","content":"The spate of bomb threats to flights of Indian airlines continued with over a dozen flights receiving threats via social media late Friday, The Indian Express has learnt.

Retail inflation, which surged to a nine-month high of 5.49 per cent in September from 3.65 per cent in August, is expected to remain elevated in October before moderating in November, Das said in a fireside chat at the India Credit Forum hosted by Bloomberg. ‚ÄúI would like to say that certainly, we are not behind the curve.

The muted response from retail investors was due to multiple reasons, including higher offer price leading to an excessive valuation of HMIL‚Äôs, weak demand for passenger vehicles, especially in the sport utility segment, and the entire IPO proceeds going to the HMIL‚Äôs promoters, analysts said. ‚ÄúThe weak from retail investors was because such large issues in the past have disappointed post-listing. The most important concern was that at the offer price, HMIL is commanding a premium valuation than Maruti Suzuki,‚Äù said G Chokkalingam, Founder & Head of Research, Equinomics Research Private Ltd. The other factor was the drop in sales of passenger vehicles. The SUV (sport utility vehicle) segment, which is the focus area of Hyundai Motor India, used to grow in strong double-digit earlier but now the segment is growing in the single-digit, he said. ‚ÄúThere were a lot of red flags. A couple of days before the company announced the final numbers (on the number of shares to be issued), it was expected that the IPO would be Rs 25,000 crore. With the final IPO size of around Rs 28,000 crore, the pricing became 11-12 per cent higher than what was expected. Due to this, the grey market price of the IPO also crashed,‚Äù said market analyst Ambareesh Baliga. The amount of Rs 10,782 crore paid as dividend by HMIL to its promoter Hyundai Motor Company (HMC) in March 2024 also weighed on investor sentiments. Baliga said HMIL could have taken out the money in the form of dividend slowly as the IPO was planned well in advance. Taking out close to Rs 11,000 crore doesn‚Äôt leave a good taste as there is nothing left for investors on table, he said. ‚ÄúOutcome of #HyundaiMotorsIPO : Those investing own money found the #IPO expensive ‚Äì Those #investing others money found it attractive ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶,‚Äù he wrote on microblogging site X (formerly Twitter). The non-institutional investors (NIIs) category was also undersubscribed, as 1.27 crore bids were received, against the quota of 2.12 crore shares, representing only 60 per cent subscription. A comparison of six large issues ‚Äì Hyundai Motor India, Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC), One 97 Communications, Coal India, Reliance Power and General Insurance Corporation (GIC) shows that HMIL‚Äôs IPO received the lowest response from retail investors at 50 per cent. The retail category of Reliance Power‚Äôs IPO was subscribed 14.87 times, followed by Coal India at 2.31 times, LIC at 2.91 times, One 97 Communications at 1.66 times and GIC at 0.63 times. QIBs come to the rescue The IPO received a total of 23.63 crore shares as against 9.97 crore offered. Nearly 83 per cent of the bids came from QIBs. Institutional investors placed bids for 19.72 crore shares, nearly 7 times their allocated shares of 2.82 crore. The employee quota was booked at 174 per cent, with the portion receiving 13.56 lakh applications compared to 7.78 lakh shares offered.

All existing Vistara flights will continue to be operated using its existing fleet of aircraft and crew, although the flight numbers will change to those of Air India, the latter said Friday. ‚ÄúFor instance, UK 955 (UK is the current airline identifier code for Vistara flights) will become AI 2955, helping customers identify them while booking,‚Äù Air India said. Air India also announced that following the airlines‚Äô merger, which will also include the merger of their loyalty programmes, the combined loyalty programme will evolve into an all new avatar under the brand ‚ÄòMaharaja Club‚Äô ‚Äî a reference to the Air India‚Äôs popular long-standing mascot. Initially, all members of the Club Vistara loyalty programme will be seamlessly transferred to Air India‚Äôs loyalty programme Flying Returns. In its nearly 10 years of operations, Vistara had made a mark for itself as the premier full-service carrier in India that offered a superior product in a market dominated by budget carriers. With the Tata group deciding to merge Vistara into the group‚Äôs flagship airline Air India‚Äìwhich the Tatas acquired from the government in January 2022‚Äìthere were concerns about Vistara‚Äôs product and service quality after the merger. Also Read | What flyers can expect in early days of Vistara‚Äôs merger with Air India Under government control, Air India was under financial stress, and this reflected in its product and service quality, which was seen as below the standards expected from a full-service carrier. While the now-privatised airline has undertaken a mammoth fleet modernisation and expansion plan, it still has a large number of legacy aircraft that are in a rundown state. ‚ÄúThe routes and schedule operated by Vistara aircraft will continue to be the same, alongside the Vistara in-flight experience that includes the product and service such as menu and cutlery on the Vistara aircraft. It will also be serviced by the same crew,‚Äù Air India said. ‚ÄúIn parallel, Air India‚Äôs narrowbody fleet continues to be upgraded with new aircraft being delivered, legacy aircraft being refitted with entirely new interiors and Vistara‚Äôs catering now also extended to Air India,‚Äù the airline added. The wheels for the merger were set in motion in 2022 after the Tata group acquired Air India from the government. As a joint venture partner in Vistara, Singapore Airlines holds 49 per cent stake in the airline and will have 25.1 per cent stake in the enlarged Air India after the merger. Apart from merging Air India and Vistara, the Tata group had decided to merge its budget carriers Air India Express and AIX Connect (formerly AirAsia India). That merger took effect from October 1. Once the Air India-Vistara merger is complete, the Air India group will have a full-service carrier Air India and a low-cost airline Air India Express. The consolidation is a critical part of Air India‚Äôs transformation programme Vihaan.Ai, that seeks to build Air India into an airline of global repute.","category":"business"},{"publishedAt":"2024-10-22","title":"Kerala doctor suicide: Police arrest friend who backed out of marriage","description":"Shahana (26), a postgraduate student in the surgery department of the Government Medical College here, was found unconscious at her apartment and later declared brought dead at the hospital on Tuesday.","urlToImage":"https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/10/handcuff-4-2.jpg?w=640","content":"Two days after a female medical student‚Äôs suicide shocked the consciousness of the state, police on Thursday took into custody a doctor who had allegedly backed out of their marriage proposal recently as her family couldn‚Äôt meet the demand for hefty dowry. Shahana (26), a postgraduate student in the surgery department of the Government Medical College here, was found unconscious at her apartment and later declared brought dead at the hospital on Tuesday. Shahana allegedly took the extreme step as she was depressed due to a big dowry sought by the groom‚Äôs family, her family alleged. Based on their statements, Ruwais, her friend who is also a post graduate doctor in the College, was taken into custody from Karunagappally early today, police said. ‚ÄúWe have taken him into custody based on the statements of the victim‚Äôs family. He is being interrogated,‚Äù a senior officer told PTI. He said a case of unnatural death was registered soon after the woman doctor‚Äôs death. Sections of abetment to suicide and Dowry Prohibition Act were added based on the statements of Dr Shahana‚Äôs family, he added. ‚ÄúWe have to check the veracity of various statements we have recorded. Further proceedings including his arrest will be decided only after that,‚Äù the officer said. On Wednesday, the government had ordered a probe into the death of Shahana after allegations of dowry related issues causing the suicide cropped up. Health Minister Veena George directed the director of the Women and Child Development Department to carry out a probe and submit a report regarding this. The state Minority Commission also intervened into the issue and initiated a case on its own based on media reports in this regard. Its Chairperson A A Rasheed directed the district collector, city police commissioner and director of medical education to appear before the Commission during its next sitting here on December 14 and submit a report on the incident. State Women‚Äôs Commission Chairperson P Sathidevi visited Shahana‚Äôs residence in nearby Venjaramoodu and consoled her mother on Wednesday. The victim‚Äôs father, who was working in the Middle East, died recently. Expressing grief and concern over the alleged suicide of the young doctor, Sathidevi said stringent measures should be taken if the mental agony caused due to dowry had forced her to take the extreme step. People close to the deceased‚Äôs family had alleged that Shahana was depressed as her friend had backed out of their marriage citing dowry as the reason.","category":"kerala"},{"publishedAt":"2024-10-22","title":"Kerala Muslim leader says CPM leaders promoting interfaith marriages involving Muslim girls","description":"Nasar Faizy Koodathai, secretary of the Sunni Yuvajana Sangham, warns the community about the ruling party‚Äôs 'tactics with the label of secularism‚Äô.","urlToImage":"https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/12/Nasar-Faizy-Koodathai.jpg?w=640","content":"A prominent Muslim leader in Kerala has accused the ruling CPM of promoting interfaith marriages in such a way that Muslim girls are ‚Äúbeing abducted and married off to non-Muslims‚Äù with the backing of the party and its youth and student wings. While addressing a meeting in Kozhikode, Nasar Faizy Koodathai, secretary of the Sunni Yuvajana Sangham, the youth wing of the influential Samastha Kerala Jem-iyyathul Ulama, said the community should remain vigilant about the CPM‚Äôs ‚Äútactics with the label of secularism‚Äù. Koodathai said that for certain people, secularism means a Hindu marrying a Muslim. ‚ÄúRecently we have seen unscrupulous political strategies to promote interfaith marriages. The Constitution permits that a Muslims should marry a Muslim and Hindu should marry Hindu. But certain people have a crooked view that Bhartiya culture can be promoted only when a Hindu marries a Muslim. Muslim girls are being abducted with the backing of the party‚Äôs offices, newspaper offices, leaders of the CPM, DYFI and the SFI, and they are being married off to non-Muslims. Mahallu (masjid) committees should stand united against such rejection of religion,‚Äô‚Äô he said. This is the first time a leader associated with the influential body of Sunni Muslim clerics has publicly spoken against interfaith marriage in a state where Hindu and Christian outfits have accused Muslims of engaging in ‚Äúlove jihad‚Äô‚Äô. The Samastha Kerala Jem-iyyathul Ulama, or Samastha, is close to the Indian Union Muslim League, an ally of the Congress in Kerala. However, the CPM has recently been wooing Muslims through the organisation and its leaders have shared stages with the clerics on many issues. The government was accused of withdrawing plans to introduce gender-neutral uniforms in schools following protests, mainly from Samastha, which was of the view that such uniforms would encourage homosexuality.","category":"kerala"},{"publishedAt":"2024-10-22","title":"Renowned economist and Dalit thinker M Kunjaman found dead at home","description":"A native of Vadanamkurissi in Palakkad, Kunjaman was born to the Dalit community of Panan.","urlToImage":"https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/12/kunjaman.jpg?w=640","content":"Renowned economist, academician and prominent Dalit thinker M Kunjaman, 74, was found dead at his residence here on Sunday evening. He served as an Economics faculty at the University of Kerala, member of the University Grants Commission and professor at the Tuljapur campus of Tata Institute of Social Science (TISS). Kunjaman‚Äôs life is a remarkable journey of a Dalit amid caste oppression and poverty in the initial period of post-independent India to a well-known academician. Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan, in his condolence, said, ‚ÄúKunjaman has been an economist who had his own perspective towards the development of Kerala. His autobiography, Ethiru, was a true reflection of the realities of life. His death is a big loss to Kerala.‚Äù A native of Vadanamkurissi in Palakkad, Kunjaman was born to the Dalit community of Panan. His parents were farm workers. He lived in abject poverty. Oppression remained a shadow throughout his journey. Recalling his childhood days, Kunjaman had once narrated how he had to grapple with dogs for daily meals. He grew up eating the leftovers of the rich landlords. Kunjaman struggled all his way to higher education while elementary education was rare for peers in his community. In 1974, he won the first rank in MA in Economics. He then became the second Dalit after late president K R Narayanan to bag first rank in post-graduation. But poverty continued to haunt the Dalit rank holder. He was forced to sell the gold medal, day after it was conferred to him, to buy provisions for his home. After MA in Economics, he joined MPhil at the Centre for Development Studies (CDS) in Thiruvananthapuram and later went on to obtain doctorate in Economics from Cochin University of Science and Technology. Even then, Kunjaman was initially denied the job of a teacher despite emerging as the top scorer in the merit list under the general quota. He was denied a job for being a Dalit. But well-wishers identified the brilliant academician in the Dalit youth, who began his career with the University of Kerala in 1979. He served as a faculty at the Economics Department for 27 years. For a brief period, he had been a member of the UGC. In 2006, he quit the University of Kerala and joined as a Professor of Economics at TISS. In 2021, his autobiography ‚ÄòEthiru‚Äô had been selected as the best autobiography by the Kerala Sahitya Academy. But Kunjaman refused to accept the honour. In his autobiography, Kunjaman had depicted the Dalit life in Kerala. He had authored several studies on land reforms, reservation and the Dalit crisis. His major works include ‚ÄòDevelopment of Tribal Economy, State Level Planning In India, Globalization: A Subaltern Perspective, Economic Development and Social changing‚Äô. Kunjaman had been considered for several posts in the academic and planning arenas of Kerala but caste had apparently remained a major barrier.","category":"kerala"},{"publishedAt":"2024-10-22","title":"Kidnapping that gripped Kerala ends in arrest of couple and their YouTuber daughter","description":"The girl was abducted on Monday from Oyoor town and was found abandoned, but safe, at a ground in Kollam city the next day.","urlToImage":"https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/12/Kerala-police.jpg?w=640","content":"The abduction of a six-year-old girl in Kerala‚Äôs Kollam district ‚Äì a case that has gripped the state this week ‚Äì culminated with the arrest of a popular YouTuber and her parents on Saturday. The girl was abducted on Monday from Oyoor town and was found abandoned, but safe, at a ground in Kollam city the next day. Since then, police have been on the hunt for the kidnappers. On Friday, police traced the three accused ‚Äì businessman K R Padmakumar (52), his wife Anitha Kumar (45), and their daughter, YouTuber and social media influencer P Anupama (20) ‚Äì to Tenkasi in Tamil Nadu. The three were residents of Chathannoor in Kollam. Their arrest was registered on Saturday. It was a ransom call made by Anitha, demanding Rs 10 lakh from the girl‚Äôs family, that eventually led police to the accused, after a local resident recognised her voice. Additional Director General of Police (Law and Order) M R Ajith Kumar said the family was desperate for money because of the debt racked up by Premkumar. Padmakumar, an engineering graduate, ran a local cable TV service and also did farming, but faced a severe financial crisis during the pandemic, the ADGP said. He had purportedly borrowed money to the tune of around Rs 5 crore, and needed Rs 10 lakh immediately to tide things over with his creditors. ‚ÄúThe abduction was originally planned a year back‚Ä¶ They then revived the plan one-and-a-half months ago. They were looking for targets in a remote area, away from public attention,‚Äù the ADGP said. According to him, the accused had zeroed in on the six-year-old girl days before her abduction. Padmakumar‚Äôs daughter, Anupama, is popular on YouTube and other social media, and had been earning between Rs 3 lakh and Rs 5 lakh a month until recently before her content was demonetised, ADGP Kumar said. The reason for the demonetisation was not made clear. When her payments stopped coming through, ‚Äúthe daughter, who initially objected to the crime, also stood with her parents‚Äô plan,‚Äù Kumar said. On the precautions taken by the accused ahead of the abduction, the ADGP said: ‚ÄúThe car that the family used to abduct the girl had a fake number plate, which they had prepared last year. A second fake number plate was made recently.‚Äù According to police, they would take the car out regularly to look for a child to abduct. They would change number plates mid-journey, and were careful not to use mobile phones to communicate about this matter, police said. Last week, they spotted the six-year-old and her older brother walking down the road on their way to tuition classes, and identified her as a target. According to police, they would then repeatedly survey the area, and twice tried to abduct her before pulling out at the last moment because others were around. Finally on Monday, they found the siblings alone and managed to drag the six-year-old into their car before driving away, police said. They initially covered her mouth, and then got her to calm down by saying they were taking her to her father. The next step for the abductors was to seek ransom from the girl‚Äôs family, the ADGP said. Leaving the girl at home in Chathannoor with their daughter, the couple went to Kollam‚Äôs Parippally, after which Anitha took an auto to go to a shop. After making some purchases from there, she made a call to the girl‚Äôs mother from the shop owner‚Äôs phone and demanded Rs 10 lakh ransom. She had earlier taken the mother‚Äôs number from the girl, police said. Later, when TV channels got hold of the recorded call and started telecasting it, a local resident suspected that it was a voice that he knew. After he shared his suspicion with police, it led investigators to turn their attention to Anitha. Subsequent analysis of call details helped police find more evidence to suspect Anitha. On Monday, after the couple got back to their house, they realised that the abduction had become sensational news. They also realised that police were actively searching for the girl. This put them in a panic and they decided to abandon the plan. At around 11 am on Tuesday, they took the girl to Kollam city. After parking the car, Anitha Kumari took the girl in an auto to a ground in the city where she managed to drop her off without being noticed. Police, who had launched a massive search for the girl, soon located her at the ground and reunited her with her parents. Meanwhile, the three accused decided to leave Kollam, and headed to Tenkasi in Tamil Nadu where a family friend had a farm. However, police had already identified Anitha as the woman behind the ransom call, and found she had left the state with her husband and daughter. After tracking them for a couple of days, they were located and taken into custody in Tenkasi. The three accused were charged with abduction, wrongful confinement and conspiracy. They were produced before a magistrate court, which remanded them in judicial custody for two weeks.","category":"kerala"},{"publishedAt":"2024-10-22","title":"Kerala Guv Khan blames CM Vijayan for pressuring him to reappoint Kannur VC","description":"Khan, speaking to reporters here, said that state Higher Education Minister R Bindu was not to be blamed as the CM used her for seeking reappointment of Ravindran.","urlToImage":"https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/11/Arif-Khan-Pinarayi-Vijayan-1.jpg?w=640","content":"Kerala Governor Arif Mohammed Khan on Thursday accused Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan of pressuring him to reappoint Gopinath Ravindran as the vice chancellor (VC) of Kannur University.

People‚Äôs representatives, CUSAT faculty members and hundreds of students lined past the bodies of the students. Later, the families took the bodies home. Engineering student Ann Riftha, 21, a native of Chendamangalam in Ernakulam district, was among those who died on Saturday. She was an upcoming performer of Chavittu Nadakam, a traditional musical dance drama art form popular among the Latin Catholic community in the coastal region of Kerala. She belonged to a family of Chavittu Nadakam artistes, with her father, Roy Georgekutty, a trainer in the art form. ‚ÄúThe family was passionate about Chavittu Nadakam. Ann had started performing from childhood, and in her first performance, she played an angel,‚Äù family friend Shaiby Thomas said. Ann‚Äôs father also worked as a mason, and her mother, Sindhu, has been working as a home nurse in Italy for the last one year. Rithul, Ann‚Äôs brother, was studying hotel management. ‚ÄúThe mother went to Italy to make money for her daughter‚Äôs education. She came to know about the incident through the news, but had not initially realised Ann was also a victim. She is expected to reach Kochi on Tuesday, and the funeral will be held after that,‚Äù Shaiby said. Another victim of the stampede was Athul Thambi, 24, from Koothattukulam in Ernakulam. He was the son of farm labourer Kochuparayil Thambi. Described as a brilliant student, Athul had previously been forced to abandon his studies due to the family‚Äôs financial crisis. He then got training from a polytechnic and started working as a supervisor. Later, he was able to quit his job and join CUSAT to study engineering. ‚ÄúEvery weekend, he used to come home. But yesterday (Saturday), he informed his mother, Lilly, in the evening that he would be staying back at CUSAT campus this weekend,‚Äù said Koothattukulam municipal councillor Sunny Kuriakose. He has an elder brother Ajin, who is an engineer, Kuriakose said. At Thamarassery in Kozhikode, the Thuvakkunnil family was mourning the death of Sara Thomas, 20, another engineering student. Her father, Scaria Thomas, had been bitten by a snake a few months ago and had a long battle for his life, from which he only recently emerged. ‚ÄúSara, a brilliant student, had got admission at other engineering colleges in Kerala. But the profile of CUSAT as a prestigious institution, and the fact that one of her relatives worked at the university, made the family choose that institute. Scaria Thomas is yet to recover fully from the health problems related to the snake bite. For several months since the snake bite last December, he fought for his life at hospital and later at home,‚Äô‚Äô said their neighbour and CPI(M) worker Shamsudheen. Thomas, who had worked in the Gulf, had returned home a few years ago and was living with his family in a rented house. His wife, Kochurani, is a homemaker. They have two other daughters ‚Äì the eldest is married and the youngest is a higher secondary student. The fourth victim of the tragedy, 23-year-old Alwin Joseph, was not a student. He was an electrician from Mundur in Palakkad, and had been staying in Kochi while looking for job opportunities. His father, Joseph, is a farm worker. Alwin‚Äôs plan was to eventually find a job and settle abroad. On Saturday, Alwin is thought to have gone to CUSAT for the music show. When his father saw the news of the stampede on TV, he called Alwin‚Äôs phone, but got no answer, said Mundur panchayat member K T Sabjalatha. ‚ÄúLater in the night, when they repeatedly called, someone picked up saying that they got the handset abandoned at the CUSAT venue. Soon, the tragedy was confirmed,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄòDelay in opening gate‚Äô CUSAT Vice-Chancellor P G Sankaran said there were two factors that contributed to the stampede that took place after rain started pouring down. ‚ÄúThere was a delay in opening the only gate to the auditorium. Hence, when students crowded at the only gate, it had to be opened all of a sudden. Besides, the stairs down to the amphitheatre are very steep,‚Äù he said.

On October 28, the Kozhikode city police had registered a case against Gopi under Section 354 A (sexual harassment of nature of unwelcome physical contact and explicit sexual overtures) based on a complaint from a journalist working with a TV channel. After the police served a notice to the actor, the BJP launched a campaign saying the party will not allow the government to target the leader, who is keen to contest the next Lok Sabha elections from Thrissur.

A friend of four decades introduced himself, shared family photos, and details of their mutual friends. Soon, he got a WhatsApp call from that number, and the friend asked for Rs 40,000 for his sister‚Äôs surgery. As Radhakrishan remained noncommittal, the friend came on video call. In Radhakrishan‚Äôs mind, little doubt remained. It was his friend Venu Kumar, whom he had worked with in Coal India for decades before retiring. He sent him the money on GPay. By daybreak, Kerala‚Äôs first suspected AI deepfake fraud was born. Four months in, Kozhikode city police on Friday cracked the case, arresting one of the alleged accused, Shaik Murtuzamiya Hayat Bhai (43), from Mehsana in Gujarat. Police say he allegedly arranged fake bank accounts for the prime accused, Kaushal Shah from Ahmedabad, who is on the run. City police commissioner Rajpal Meena said this is the first arrest in a cyber crime using deepfake technology ‚Äì wherein facial appearance is manipulated through deep generative methods. Prima facie, police believe Kaushal was the one who allegedly used deepfake technology to impersonate a friend of the complainant during a video call. Kozhikode cyber crime inspector Dinesh Koroth said the amount debited from the account was transferred to an account of a person in Ahmedabad. From there, it was transferred to the account of a gambling firm, where Kaushal is a regular. Eventually, the money would return to Kaushal as wins from gambling ‚Äì a strategy employed to mislead police. Inspector Koroth said the police reached Shaik from Kaushal‚Äôs call detail records. According to them, Shaik maintained several bank accounts taken in the names of poor people who were not linked to the crime. ‚ÄúWe have come to know that the accused were involved in cases of similar nature in Gujarat and Karnataka,‚Äù said the officer. Police said Kaushal is believed to have got details of the complainant and his friend from a WhatsApp group of former company employees. Kaushal, police said, is a B.Com graduate and comes from an affluent family. ‚ÄúWe have learnt that his relatives and friends have complained about his cheating habit. Banks have also filed civil cases against him,‚Äù said the inspector. Recalling the incident on July 9, Radhakrishnan, who retired from Coal India 12 years ago as a senior executive, said he did not doubt when the person who sent a flurry of messages identified himself as Venu Kumar. ‚ÄúWe had known each other for four decades. He started sending messages about my family and shared photos of his family. When I was going through these messages, I got a WhatsApp voice call from that number.‚Äù ‚ÄúThere was no reason to doubt his voice, which I had been familiar with for decades. He told me that he was at Dubai airport and would reach Mumbai that evening. His sister was in hospital and Rs 40,000 was needed for surgery. He told me that he would return the money once he reached Mumbai. He asked me to transfer Rs 40,000 to a bystander‚Äôs account. When I started to raise doubts, he immediately made a video call. His image and voice were so clear that I had no reason to doubt things anymore. He WhatsApped a number, to which I credited the amount,‚Äù he said. Radhakrishan became suspicious after the fraudster demanded another Rs 35,000. ‚ÄúI felt something was fishy then. When he insisted on the second payment, I hung up the call.‚Äù Radhakrishan then made a call to Venu Kumar, who lives in Andhra Pradesh, on his phone number that he found on a WhatsApp group of former Coal India executives. ‚ÄúWhen I called Venu, he was excited to talk to me after many years. When I shot back that we had already talked in the morning and I had transferred money to him, he was stunned. Then I realised it was a scam, and I filed a complaint with the cyber police,‚Äô‚Äô he said.","category":"kerala"},{"publishedAt":"2024-10-22","title":"We can‚Äôt be neutral when section of people face genocidal aggression, says Kerala CM on Israel-Palestine conflict","description":"\"Our Palestinian brothers are suffering.

Addressing the gathering here, Vijayan said the massive participation of the people shows that Keraleeyam was a huge success.

The week-long event was inaugurated on Kerala Piravi Day on November 1. Senior BJP leader O Rajagopal attended the event and witnessed the concluding ceremony.

The religious group decided to return to physical prayer meetings to remove any fear from its members‚Äô minds following the blasts. The Jehovah‚Äôs Witnesses traces its origins to 19th century America. The group in Kalamassery faced a major shock when one of its estranged members ‚Äî Dominic Martin ‚Äî carried out multiple blasts at one of its conventions last Sunday by using an improvised explosive device (IED). Prior to surrendering before the police, Martin released a video stating that the group‚Äôs preachings were ‚Äúseditious‚Äù and that they did not heed his warnings to change their ways, and that is why he carried out the attack. Three people, including a 12-year-old girl, lost their lives and over 50 were injured in the incident. Presently, according to a Health Department release, 20 persons are under treatment with 10 of them in intensive care and two in critical condition. The remaining eight persons are in the wards, it said. Subsequently, prayer meetings, usually held twice a week in local ‚ÄòKingdom Halls‚Äô ‚Äî which refers to a local Jehovah‚Äôs Witnesses meeting place where religious services are held ‚Äî were conducted online. ‚ÄúWe decided to return to live (physical) meetings from today to remove the fear from people‚Äôs minds. The online meetings were held only for a few days following the blasts,‚Äù T A Sreekumar, a spokesperson of the group‚Äôs India Branch in Kerala, told PTI. On being asked whether there were any additional security arrangements in place for these meetings, he said that they already had a security system in place. ‚ÄúBut we have asked everyone to be vigilant and cautious,‚Äù he added. Under the existing security system, members are examined before they enter the ‚ÄòKingdom Halls‚Äô and background checks are carried out of unknown persons, he said. ‚ÄúAn enhanced security may be required in case of larger conventions and if the police say there need to be more security arrangements, we will ensure that,‚Äù Sreekumar said. The bomb blasts last Sunday took place on the last day of a three-day prayer convention held at Kalamassery here, which was attended by over 2,000 members from across the state. However, the prayer meetings at the ‚ÄòKingdom Halls‚Äô are much smaller affairs. ‚ÄúThese are small gatherings of 50-60 members and everyone knows each other. No outsider can merely walk in like in churches or temples,‚Äù Sreekumar said. The Jehovah‚Äôs Witnesses community in India boasts 947 congregations and over 56,000 devoted ministers dedicated to sharing their interpretation of the Bible and promoting an understanding of God‚Äôs kingdom, according to the official jw.org website. Unlike mainstream Christian denominations, Jehovah‚Äôs Witnesses do not believe in the Holy Trinity (God, the Father; God, the Son ‚Äì Jesus; and God the Holy Spirit) but worship Jehovah as the ‚Äúthe God of the Bible and the Creator of all things‚Äù. Followers of the group see Jesus Christ as the son of God, and not God himself. They learn from the teachings and examples set by Christ; hence they consider themselves Christians.","category":"kerala"},{"publishedAt":"2024-10-22","title":"Food vlogger found dead at his residence in Kerala","description":"The vlogger was part of 'Eat Kochi Eat', a popular online platform for foodies in which they introduce the least explored food joints in the city.","urlToImage":"https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/11/vlogger.jpg?w=640","content":"Noted food vlogger from Kochi, Rahul N Kutty, was found dead at his residence on Saturday, police said.

He also recently sought a vigilance probe into the corruption allegations. In a letter, the state tax department informed the Congress legislator that during the verification, it was found that the Veena‚Äôs company had remitted the IGST for the amount that she received from Cochin Minerals and Rutile Ltd.

Depending on a person‚Äôs preparedness, self-assurance, and academic objectives, both choices provide unique potential. But how can one decide? Here are some pointers to look into before making this decision. 1. Managing JEE preparation and board exams Students in class 12 frequently struggle to balance their JEE Main coursework with board test preparation. Although there is a lot of overlap in the curriculum of the two exams, JEE requires a deeper comprehension and problem-solving skills, particularly in the JEE Advanced stage if you want to bag a seat at an Indian Institute of Technology (IIT). Aim for JEE Main 2025 if you think you can balance both without sacrificing any of them. However, JEE Main 2026 might be a better option if you struggle to handle the pressure of two exams and need more time to improve your understanding of the JEE syllabus. Also read | How to prepare for JEE Main 2025 at home 2. Present academic status and level of preparation Your goal should probably be to attempt JEE Main 2025 if you are in Class 12 and have been studying for the Joint Entrance Examination (JEE) for a long time using online resources, coaching classes, or self-study. After completing Class 12, it would be sensible to take the JEE Main exam if you have been successfully juggling your studies for the exam with your JEE preparation and are confident in your background in math, physics, and chemistry. However, you might think about concentrating on your board examinations for the time being and taking a drop year to properly prepare for JEE Main 2026 if your JEE preparation has not been regular or if your Class 12 syllabus is too much to handle. You might have plenty of time to review key ideas, work through more practice exams and old papers, and improve your weak areas with the extra year. 3. Self-assurance with concepts and exam strategy Those planning to sit for JEE Main 2025 must understand the basic principles and have a solid time management plan. Appearing in 2025 can offer you the opportunity to perform successfully right away if you have already honed these abilities. However, it can be advantageous to take a gap year for JEE Main 2026 if you have trouble with conceptual clarity or don‚Äôt have a good exam plan. You can refine your strategy, practice with concentration, and take mock exams to learn from your failures throughout this extra year. Benefits of a year-end drop (JEE Main 2026) There are various benefits to aiming for JEE Main 2026 after taking a drop year. ‚Äì More time to study: Without the stress of Class 12 exams, you can devote all of your attention to your JEE preparation. ‚Äì Prepare with focus: You can identify your areas of weakness and take methodical steps to strengthen them. ‚Äì Less pressure: You can concentrate fully on JEE Main and Advanced without having to worry about board exams right away. The pressure to prove yourself after taking extra time, maintaining motivation throughout the year, and avoiding burnout from prolonged study sessions are some of the difficulties that come with having a drop year. Maybe JEE Main 2026 is the correct objective for you if you think you can overcome these obstacles. In the end, you shouldn‚Äôt rush into choosing between JEE Main 2025 and JEE Main 2026. Speaking openly and honestly with your instructors, mentors, or coaching faculty is crucial. Based on your present performance, they can offer insightful analysis and help you make the best decision. A Class 12 student‚Äôs decision between JEE Main 2025 and JEE Main 2026 is based on their long-term objectives, level of confidence, and level of personal preparation. It would be best to attempt JEE Main 2025 if you are confident in your preparation so that you can promptly forward with your professional ambitions. However, JEE Main 2026 has the advantage of a full year to prepare well and get the results you want if you think additional time is needed to hone your abilities and perform well on the test.

Growing up in Badlapur, Jaunpur, Uttar Pradesh, mathematics was always my favourite subject. My journey began in Class 9 when my uncle introduced me to the world of IITs and the JEE exams, igniting my ambition to excel in engineering. Read | NTA Exam Calendar 2025 Live Updates: JEE Main, NEET UG, CUET dates expected soon Initially, my knowledge was limited to the school curriculum, but my uncle‚Äôs encouragement opened my eyes to broader possibilities. After my first attempt at JEE in 2022 didn‚Äôt yield my desired results, I recognized the value of persistence and decided to take a year off to prepare. This decision wasn‚Äôt easy, especially with family concerns and the low odds for repeaters, but I believed in seizing the second chance JEE offered me. With my family‚Äôs support, I committed to my goal, ultimately leading me to IIT Bombay. My journey to Mumbai began with a vacation to the city after my JEE Advanced exam. As the results came in and the possibility of joining IIT Bombay became real, what started as a week-long trip turned into a six-month stay, away from my family for the first time. During the JoSAA counselling, I heeded the advice of seniors who urged me to choose any branch at IIT Bombay over pursuing my preferences elsewhere, which led me to civil engineering. Adjusting to life at IIT Bombay was initially challenging. The new environment felt overwhelming, especially since I was used to growing up with my sister and cousins. Making friends proved difficult at first, but as I engaged in activities, I gradually built a supportive circle. While the mess food was a far cry from my home-cooked meals, I adapted and found comfort in the friendships I developed. My involvement in clubs and societies has been pivotal in shaping my IIT experience. I initially explored fine arts but eventually became the Editorial Design Secretary in the CEA Council and joined the EERI tech team, focusing on earthquake-resistant structures. Juggling these responsibilities with my studies has taught me valuable time management skills, and I learned that balancing academics and leisure is essential for my well-being. My daily routine is often hectic, filled with classes, projects, and my positions of responsibility (PORs), but the camaraderie with friends makes it enjoyable. I find joy in the simple pleasures, whether hanging out at Civil Cafe or going out for dinner. These moments of relaxation are crucial for unwinding from the pressures of academic life. Most significantly, IIT Bombay has transformed me into a more confident and open individual. I was once quite introverted, but now I thrive in this vibrant social environment, forging friendships across different batches and engaging in collaborative work. The late nights spent completing assignments and the shared laughter with friends have helped me break out of my shell. IIT Bombay has challenged me academically and personally, allowing me to embrace new experiences and adapt to unforeseen situations. The friendships and memories I‚Äôve created at the institute have profoundly changed me, making me proud to be a part of this remarkable community. Through my journey, I‚Äôve learned that resilience, passion, and support can lead to profound personal growth and success in one of India‚Äôs premier institutes.","category":"education"},{"publishedAt":"2024-10-22","title":"Mumbai University reschedule exams for distance & online courses; check dates","description":"All the examinations scheduled for November 19 will now be conducted on November 30, while examinations scheduled for November 20 will now occur on December 7.","urlToImage":"https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/09/Mumbai-University.jpg?w=640","content":"Due to the Assembly elections in Maharashtra, the University of Mumbai has re-scheduled certain exams of online and distance learning courses.

Mixed DI sets can be intricate, and small mistakes can lead to incorrect conclusions.","urlToImage":"https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/10/CAT-2024.jpg?w=640","content":"‚Äî Anil Somani The Common Admission Test (CAT), conducted annually by the Indian Institutes of Management (IIMs), is considered one of India‚Äôs most competitive entrance exams for getting into top business schools. In 2024, approximately 2 to 2.8 lakh candidates are expected to take the CAT exam out of the nearly 3.5 lakh participants registered, reflecting the ongoing strong interest in pursuing management education. The exam assesses candidate proficiency in various domains such as quantitative ability, verbal ability, reading comprehension, logical reasoning, and data interpretation. Among these sections, data interpretation is often a challenging section for many aspirants due to its complexity, especially when presented in mixed data sets. These sets typically involve data presented in multiple formats, like tables, graphs, and charts, which must be interpreted simultaneously. CAT 2024 | How can non-engineers score above 95 percentile in Quantitative Aptitude Here are the key strategies to master mixed data interpretation sets in CAT 2024 exams: Try to master the basic mathematical concepts Before tackling the complexities of mixed Data Interpretation (DI) sets, it‚Äôs important to build a strong foundation in essential mathematical concepts. These include percentages, ratios & proportions, and averages, frequently used in DI problems for comparisons, data analysis, and summarisation. Mastering these basic concepts not only enhances one‚Äôs ability to interpret complex data but also improves accuracy and speed in solving DI problems. Understand the relationships between the given data Mixed DI sets often require linking data from multiple sources to solve a problem. For example, a table might show raw sales numbers, while a pie chart provides a breakdown of sales by region. So one needs to develop the ability to draw connections between these data sets and interpret the big picture. Take proper time to analyse how the pieces of data relate to one another before starting your calculations. Accuracy first, then speed In the initial stages of your preparation, prioritise accuracy over speed. Mixed DI sets can be intricate, and small mistakes can lead to incorrect conclusions. Once you have built confidence in your accuracy, gradually incorporate time-based practice to enhance your speed while maintaining precision. Utilise approximation techniques In many cases, exact calculations are not necessary, approximation values can also be sufficient. When you are dealing with complex calculations, especially under time constraints, it is beneficial to round numbers or use simpler values to estimate answers quickly. This approach allows you to avoid lengthy computations while still coming to a close approximation of the correct result. Eliminating the wrong options Since data in DI sets is frequently correlated, questions are also interconnected to each other. As a result, when answering any problem, keep in mind that the answer to even one question can help you solve any other question by identifying the incorrect options. You only have to improve your analytical skills, and most of the time, you may get the perfect answer by removing the incorrect one, saving you time and energy. Practice with previous year papers and mock tests Regularly solving past CAT papers and taking mock tests is essential for building familiarity with different types of DI questions. Mock tests help simulate exam conditions, allowing you to practice under time pressure while identifying your strengths and areas for improvement. The more you practice, the better you will become at solving mixed DI sets. After each mock test, analyse your performance to understand where you went wrong and how you can improve. Focus on the mistakes and challenges you face with mixed DI sets and then refine your strategy accordingly. Additionally, the rigorous demands of CAT preparation can lead to heightened stress and fatigue. Incorporating mindfulness practices such as yoga and meditation can significantly enhance one‚Äôs overall well-being and exam performance. Yoga helps to reduce stress while promoting physical strength and flexibility. Also, practicing meditation even for just 15-20 minutes daily can help to develop a calm and focused mindset, which enhances your ability to concentrate on complex data interpretation tasks. Mindfulness meditation can help you clear your mental chaos and approach your studies more clearly. Integrating these mindfulness practices into one‚Äôs regular routine can help to retain balance and serenity while preparing for the examination.

You can read the stories¬†here.) ‚Äî Nagalaxmi M Raman In the realm of global affairs and politics there has been an ongoing debate about the distinction between international studies and international relations. While these two fields share a common focus on the interconnected nature of the world, they differ in their scope, approaches and career implications. International studies is a broad, multidisciplinary field that encompasses various aspects of global issues, including politics, economics, culture, and history. It aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the complex and dynamic relationships that exist between nations, international organizations, and non-state actors. This interdisciplinary approach allows students to explore diverse perspectives and develop a nuanced understanding of the world. Read | Life in a Foreign University | ‚ÄòHow IGNOU‚Äôs NAAC grade helped me get US varsity admission‚Äô On the other hand, international relations is a more focused discipline that primarily examines the political, diplomatic, and strategic interactions between states and other global actors. It delves into the complexities of power dynamics, conflict resolution, and the formulation and implementation of foreign policies. While there is some overlap between the two fields, the career implications and placement opportunities can vary significantly. International studies graduates may find employment in a wide range of sectors, including government agencies, non-governmental organizations, international businesses, research institutions, and educational institutions. They may work as diplomats, policy analysts, international development specialists, or cultural liaisons, among other roles. In contrast, international relations graduates are often better positioned for careers in government, diplomacy, and international organizations, such as the United Nations, the World Bank, or the International Monetary Fund. They may work as foreign policy analysts, political risk consultants, or national security specialists. Things that students must consider Interests and skills: Think about if you would prefer to concentrate on the political and diplomatic elements of international relations or pursue a broad multidisciplinary study in international studies. Examine the abilities you hope to acquire. Critical thinking and cultural knowledge are essential for international studies. Political analysis and negotiating abilities might be more important in international relations. Regional vs global focus: If you‚Äôd like a regional concentration, some programs offer niche fields (like Middle Eastern studies) that can be appealing. Opportunities for research: Seek out courses that provide chances for research in your area of interest. A thesis or capstone project may be required for many programs in international relations that place an emphasis on fostering research abilities. Placement possibilities: When deciding between these fields, students should carefully consider their personal interests, career aspirations, and the specific skills they hope to develop. International studies may appeal to those with a broader, more interdisciplinary outlook, while international relations may be more suitable for those with a stronger focus on political, strategic, and diplomatic dimensions of global affairs. Graduates frequently work in academia, think tanks, political consultancy, international organizations (like the UN), and government (diplomacy, international agencies). These positions include those of political analyst, intelligence analyst, diplomat, and foreign service officer. Career services departments at many colleges offer resources tailored to foreign studies and relations, such as job fairs, networking opportunities, and internships. Internships with NGOs, governments, global companies(MNCs), and international organisations can be beneficial for students. Strong alumni networks from certain programs can be able to assist with mentorships and job placements. Other aspects A large number of graduates in both disciplines can go on to earn advanced degrees, such as master‚Äôs degrees with specialisations in public policy, international relations, or global studies. While both fields promote a worldwide view, it is important to take into account the ways in which each program integrates fieldwork, study abroad opportunities, global education, and foreign internships. Being able to communicate effectively in foreign contexts and advancing professional prospects are two major benefits of being proficient in foreign languages.

However, not everyone is able to crack or get their desired college in the first attempt. Many students struggle with the decision of whether to take a year off before taking the NEET exam. Making the difficult choice to take a drop year can have a tremendous impact on a student‚Äôs emotional and academic life. Also read | NTA Exam Calendar 2025 Live Updates Understanding the plan of action A thorough understanding of courses such as biology, physics, and chemistry is required for one of the most difficult competitive tests in India. Though they might not succeed on their first try, many students need years of coaching to finally get it right. Having a ‚Äúdrop year‚Äù becomes an option in this situation. To completely concentrate on exam preparation, a drop year is a break between two academic years. With no obligation to attend both school and coaching at the same time, it enables students to devote all of their time to their studies. Advantages of taking a drop year 1. NEET preparation: With a drop year, students can focus just on this aspect of their studies. With no outside distractions, they can properly review topics, take practice exams, and concentrate on their weakest areas. 2. Better time management: Students can set aside more time to study and strengthen their understanding of difficult subjects when they are not burdened by school or college tasks. To accommodate their preferred pace and learning style, they can design a personalised schedule. 3. Enhanced self-belief: It might be really stressful to finish schoolwork while getting ready for the NEET.

Overcome your previous mistakes: Students who have taken the NEET are already aware of their weaknesses. A year off allows them to see where they made errors, learn from them, and improve their approach the next time around. The difficulties of taking a year off 1. Pressure on the mind and emotions: Taking a year off can be emotionally taxing, particularly if you see your friends advance while you stay in school and prepare. It‚Äôs possible to experience dissatisfaction, self-doubt, or failure-related fear. It‚Äôs critical to keep an optimistic outlook. 2. Uncertainty of outcomes: Success is not assured even with a low year. Students may feel a great deal of uncertainty. Thus, even after spending a full year preparing, one should be ready to confront obstacles. 3. Parental and societal pressure: Taking a drop year may not always have the complete backing of parents or other family members. Stress can be increased by peer pressure and comparing one‚Äôs own development to others. Receiving emotional support and maintaining communication with family members is crucial. 4. Academic journey gap: Some students may find it disconcerting if they have a drop year, which indicates a break in their academic schedule. If, however, you are able to obtain a medical seat following a drop year, this is not a significant problem. Things to think about prior to taking a drop year ‚Äì Self-evaluation: Examine your past performance prior to making this choice. Determine if taking a year off will make a big difference in your chances. Think about if you still have the will and self-control to study hard for an additional year. ‚Äì Alternative strategy: It‚Äôs a good idea to have a plan B. After the drop year, consider your course of action in the event that things do not go as planned. If NEET isn‚Äôt your best fit, think about looking into other medical specialties or fields (such paramedical studies). ‚Äì Health and well-being: During the drop year, remember to look after your physical and emotional health. Regular exercise, hobbies, and breaks can help maintain balance because constant preparation can be exhausting. If you are sincere about becoming a doctor and think you can perform better with more time to prepare, then taking a drop year to be ready for NEET UG can be a wise choice. It‚Äôs crucial to thoroughly consider the benefits and drawbacks, and if you decide to drop, make sure you have a strong plan and support network in place.

Now Left wants BJP to explain position on draft rules which, it claims, will take sheen off the Pooram fireworks.","urlToImage":"https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/10/Untitled-design-10-3.jpg?w=640","content":"Thrissur Pooram festival, which had generated much political fireworks over the BJP‚Äôs first-ever victory from a Lok Sabha seat in Kerala, is back to rekindle state politics. The CPI(M)-led government in Kerala has raised concern over a recent Central government notification of the draft of The Explosives (Amendment) Rules, 2024, saying that certain conditions would affect the display of fireworks at Thrissur Pooram, which are a major attraction of the annual event. State Revenue Minister K Rajan, who is a senior CPI leader from Thrissur, has rushed a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, urging his intervention in the issue. As per the draft rules, magazine fireworks should be at least 200 metres away from the display site, from where the public views the show. At Thrissur Pooram, the existing distance between the magazine and display site is 45 metres. The condition that there should be a gap of 100 metres between the spectators and the display, the state government said, will ‚Äútake the sheen out of the spectacle‚Äù. Another proposed norm is that the assembly shed, where items for the fireworks are stored, should be at least 100 metres away from the display site. But since the assembly shed will be empty during the display, the Kerala government says there is ‚Äúno logic in this stipulation‚Äù. Rajan said these norms would make conducting the Pooram fireworks display difficult. ‚ÄúThese norms amount to an open challenge to the festival. If the norms are implemented, the conduct of fireworks will be impossible at the Thekkinkadu ground (where the event is staged every year),‚Äù the minister said. Pooram is regarded as one of Kerala‚Äôs most important festivals, particularly for the people of Thrissur. This year‚Äôs Pooram, held days before the Lok Sabha elections, was marred by the police restrictions on crowd management. Temple authorities had to abandon even the ritualistic proceedings in the wake of the restrictions. Besides, for the first time in the festival‚Äôs modern history, the display of fireworks, which was scheduled for the small hours of April 20, was held in broad daylight instead. When uncertainty loomed over the fireworks display, BJP‚Äôs Thrissur Lok Sabha candidate and actor Suresh Gopi dramatically emerged and held discussions with temple authorities at 3 am on April 20, leading to the daylight display of fireworks. Gopi, who ultimately won in Thrissur, was hailed for his intervention. A police probe later found that the Pooram disruptions were ‚Äúdeliberate‚Äù and ‚Äúpre-planned‚Äù with an eye on the Lok Sabha elections. The state government earlier this month ordered a probe into the lapses on the part of then ADGP (Law and Order) M R Ajith Kumar in imposing police restrictions and antagonising the public. He is also in the dock for meeting RSS national leaders, though the motive of the meeting remains a mystery, according to a probe report tabled in the Assembly. Earlier this month, Kumar was stripped of his Law and Order charge, though he is continuing as the ADGP of the Armed Police Battalion. Ensuring the display of fireworks has now become the onus of the BJP as its rivals allege the Pooram botch-up contributed to the party‚Äôs first-ever Lok Sabha win in Kerala. BJP state vice-president advocate B Gopalakrishnan, who also hails from Thrissur, said, ‚ÄúWe will see that the conduct of Pooram fireworks gets an exemption or special sanction. It is our task and we have already taken up the matter with the Union government. Every year, there are restrictions for the safe conduct of fireworks. But the issue of Pooram should not be used as a shield for conduct of any other fireworks in violation of the norms,‚Äù he said.","category":"politics"},{"publishedAt":"2024-10-22","title":"Nitish Kumar settled in NDA, former aide R C P Singh feels the cold, explores separate party","description":"JD(U) chief's former second-in-command has been on the margins since the Bihar CM‚Äôs return to the NDA fold earlier this year.","urlToImage":"https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/10/Untitled-design-7-6.jpg?w=640","content":"Upset with the BJP for not giving him any key responsibility since he joined the party just over a year ago, former Union Minister Ram Chandra Prasad Singh, better known as R C P Singh, is likely to float his party. A former second-in-command of Nitish Kumar, Singh quit the Janata Dal (United) in 2022 after falling out with the Bihar Chief Minister. The following year, he joined the BJP, taking potshots at Kumar whom he accused of ‚Äúcompromising with crime and corruption‚Äù in his pursuit of ‚Äúkursi (chair)‚Äù, calling the JD(U) supremo a ‚Äúpaltimaar (one who makes frequent U-turns)‚Äù, and warning that he would be left with ‚Äúnothing‚Äù in Bihar. However, with Kumar‚Äôs return to the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in January, Singh was more isolated in the BJP. ‚ÄúSome people were saying that I am not seen anywhere. But I have been very much active, talking to my supporters who have been pressurising me to float our party,‚Äù Singh said recently, adding that he had not sought the renewal of his BJP membership during the party‚Äôs ongoing membership drive. He also said he would call a press conference soon to announce his decision. Last week, the former Union Minister‚Äôs supporters put up posters across Patna that said, ‚ÄúTiger abhi zinda hai‚Äù and ‚ÄúTiger returns‚Äù. Singh said his party would contest the Bihar Assembly elections next year, adding he was not looking to hurt any party. He refrained from criticising either senior BJP leaders or Nitish Kumar, his former mentor. ‚ÄúI have not met him since mid-2022. I won‚Äôt blame any person for what happened in past,‚Äù said the former Union Minister. ‚ÄúOur party gave R C P Singh due respect. One is free to pursue one‚Äôs political goals,‚Äù said BJP national spokesperson Guru Prakash Paswan. JD(U) chief spokesperson Neeraj Kumar said Singh was praising Nitish because he ‚Äúfeels politically alienated‚Äù. He added, ‚ÄúSingh has lost his political credibility and there is no question of his return to the JD(U). In the recent past, he praised Tejashwi Prasad Yadav and Prashant Kishor as well. It only shows his political desperation.‚Äù An Uttar Pradesh-cadre IAS officer, Singh had first come in contact with Nitish when he was posted as private secretary to then Union minister Beni Prasad Verma in 1996. Nitish and Singh are said to have bonded over the fact that both come from Nalanda district in Bihar and are Kurmi (as was Verma). Nitish is also said to have been impressed with Singh‚Äôs acumen as a bureaucrat. When Nitish became Railway Minister, Singh became his special secretary, later following the JD(U) leader through his various portfolios. After Nitish became CM in November 2005, Singh moved to Bihar. He came to play a key role in postings, and as Nitish‚Äôs principal secretary, was seen as the CM‚Äôs voice. Soon, his influence extended to the JD(U). In 2010, Singh took voluntary retirement and the JD(U) nominated him to the Rajya Sabha. He was renominated in 2016. The differences between the two started around the time the Cabinet of the second Narendra Modi government was formed. Nitish reportedly wanted berths for Singh as well as his other long-time lieutenant, Rajiv Ranjan Singh alias Lalan Singh. When that didn‚Äôt come through, the JD(U) stayed out. In the 2021 Cabinet expansion, Singh, believe surprisingly found himself appointed Union Steel Minister. He reportedly forwarded his name without Nitish‚Äôs consent, causing irreparable damage to their relationship. Singh‚Äôs space in the NDA in Bihar shrunk not only because of Nitish but also due to another former JD(U) leader who had antagonised the Bihar CM, Upendra Kushwaha. The Rashtriya Lok Morcha leader who joined the ruling alliance last year is also from an Other Backward Class (OBC) community. The BJP believed that with Nitish and Kushwaha part of the NDA and it too having a Kushwaha face in its rank in Deputy CM Samrat Choudhary, its Luv-Kush (Kurmi-Koeri) constituency was intact. Moreover, Singh has always been a Rajya Sabha member and has not proved its electoral strength by contesting general elections, either for the Lok Sabha or the Assembly.","category":"politics"},{"publishedAt":"2024-10-22","title":"Meet BJP‚Äôs Navya Haridas, the ‚Äòaccidental politician‚Äô taking on Priyanka Gandhi in Wayanad","description":"Navya, a former software engineer, grew up attending RSS events.

And that changed everything. ‚ÄúI had returned to Kozhikode for a short vacation with my children. It was election time, and the BJP approached me with a ticket, considering my family‚Äôs Sangh Parivar background. I was fielded from the general seat in the corporation. Overnight, I became the candidate. My plan was to return to Singapore if I had lost.‚Äù But Navya never ended up going back to her corporate life. She became a councillor in 2015 and retained her seat again in 2020. In the 2021 Assembly elections, she took the big political plunge and was fielded as the BJP candidate from the Kozhikode South seat. She lost the seat to Indian National League candidate Ahamed Devarkovil, but ended up increasing the BJP vote share from 16.56% in the 2016 Assembly polls to 20.89% in the 2021 polls. Navya will now face the biggest political battle of her career, in a seat that will have the spotlight on it because of the Gandhis‚Äô close association to it. Wayanad and Rae Bareli were the two seats Lok Sabha Leader of Opposition Rahul Gandhi contested in the recent Lok Sabha polls. He retained the latter, necessitating a bypoll in Wayanad. His sister Priyanka will now make her electoral debut from the seat ‚Äî increasing the stakes for the Congress in the state. Navya says she is unfazed by the ‚Äúprofile of rival candidates‚Äù in Wayanad. ‚ÄúPriyanka Gandhi‚Äôs acceptance is only because of her links with the Nehru family. Rahul Gandhi had breached a promise to the people of Wayanad. He abandoned the constituency only to pave the way for his sister. No other local Congress leaders were considered for Wayanad.

She adds that her ‚Äúeducational background‚Äù as well as ‚Äúthe acceptance she gained as a representative of the Kozhikode corporation‚Äù will help her reach out to people.

There was a sympathy factor at work for the MVA in the Lok Sabha polls (after the way the BJP had split the Shiv Sena and NCP). It took the MVA tally to 30 out of 48 seats in Maharashtra, coming as a shock to the BJP. Will the sympathy for the MVA continue unabated in the Assembly polls, now that people have already given an expression to it? That question hangs out there ‚Äì unanswered. Minister of Home Affairs Amit Shah along with Maharashtra Deputy Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis, Maharashtra BJP President Chandrashekhar Bawankule and Mumbai BJP President Ashish Shelar during the BJP party workers‚Äô meet, in Mumbai. (PTI photo) All eyes are on Maharashtra today, due to go to the polls on November 20. Maharashtra is important not only because it is the country‚Äôs second largest state. Along with Uttar Pradesh, it was responsible for robbing the BJP of a clear majority in the recently held Lok Sabha elections. Being the country‚Äôs commercial hub, its access to finance adds to its political clout. Today its import also lies in the timing of the Assembly elections. Their outcome will enable the winning side to seize the political initiative nationally. Little Haryana became instrumental in giving new heart to an otherwise demoralised BJP, which had lost steam after the Lok Sabha polls. It broke the momentum of the Congress‚Äôs 99-member Lok Sabha victory, which had enabled the grand old party to act as if it had won the game. But if the MVA wrests Maharashtra from the BJP-led Mahayuti, Haryana would be forgotten very quickly. Though no two states are the same, and Assembly elections are fought essentially on local issues, yet the ‚ÄúH‚Äù factor will influence the poll strategy of both sides in Maharashtra. It has already enthused a down and out BJP cadre, invigorating them with the feeling, ‚ÄúHum haari hui baazi bhi jeet sakte hain (We can win even a losing battle)‚Äù. Even the body language of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, according to his colleagues, has become visibly different after the ‚ÄúH‚Äù victory. It has toughened the BJP‚Äôs bargaining power vis-a-vis its two allies, the Eknath Shinde-led Shiv Sena and the Ajit Pawar-headed NCP. At one of the seat-sharing meetings held with Shinde, Ajit Pawar, and the BJP‚Äôs Devendra Fadnavis, Home Minister Amit Shah was reported to have told Shinde words to the effect, ‚ÄúWe have sacrificed a lot to make you Chief Minister. Now you too should sacrifice (to leave more seats for the BJP).‚Äù The RSS, headquartered in Nagpur, has already started to work proactively for the BJP in Maharashtra, as it did in Haryana (after holding itself back in the Lok Sabha elections). There have been many meetings between the Sangh leaders and the BJP brass to address the RSS‚Äôs reservations ‚Äì articulated by RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat ‚Äî about the BJP leadership‚Äôs style of functioning. The RSS hold-back hurt the party in states like Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan. The BJP and RSS have yet to reveal their ‚Äúchoice by consensus‚Äù for the next BJP president, about which extensive discussions have taken place. Also in Political Pulse | Congress‚Äôs Maharashtra game plan: How party is planning to avoid Haryana mistakes in next poll battleground The recent RSS-BJP parleys have also strengthened Fadnavis‚Äôs position in the BJP, and he is being increasingly seen as the party‚Äôs best bet today, even as the Mahayuti will fight the election under the stewardship of CM Shinde. Fadnavis was downgraded by the high command to accept Deputy CMship when Shinde was made CM in 2022. After the recent Lok Sabha polls, there was a buzz that he might be moved to Delhi. The BJP will also push for a greater consolidation of the OBCs (Malis, Dhangarhs, Vanjaris) in its favour ‚Äì as it did in Haryana, with the Jat versus non-Jat polarisation taking the party to an unexpected victory. In Maharashtra, the Maratha-OBC divide has sharpened after the Maratha agitation for reservations, and the MVA calculates this divide will benefit the alliance. The BJP, on the other hand, hopes that both its allies Shinde and Ajit Pawar, who are Marathas, will pull in some Maratha votes. Incidentally the two leaders have not really been attacked by Manoj Jarange Patil, who is spearheading the agitation for reservation for the Marathas. He has concentrated his fire instead against Fadnavis (a Brahmin) for obstructing Maratha reservation and asked Marathas to vote for one of their own but not for the BJP. Eknath Shinde has firmed up his leadership after the Lok Sabha polls; he had a better strike rate than the others. He has been on a sop-announcing spree, and projected himself as the author of the popular Mukhyamantri Majhi Ladki Bahin Yojana (giving Rs 1,500 per month to women between 18-60) ‚Äì expected to be the game changer for the Mahayuti, as it was for the BJP in Madhya Pradesh. The BJP may also play the ‚ÄòIndependents‚Äô card in Maharashtra, as it did in Haryana and in J&K. There were 17 seats where the Congress lost because of Independents (some of them were Congress rebels) in Haryana. In J&K too, a large number of Independents were in the fray, but did not cut ice against the National Conference. In Maharashtra, the game may be played by both sides; it has been the hallmark of Sharad Pawar‚Äôs politics for four decades and more. Come now to the MVA. What lessons has the Congress learnt from its defeat in Haryana? Not to put all its eggs in one basket, and project one leader as it did in Haryana (backing Bhupinder Singh Hooda)? In Maharashtra, it has decided to rely on its satraps, strong in their respective regions in the state. Even as it garners a sizeable chunk of the Maratha vote, the challenge for the MVA is also to keep the Dalits by its side and not have them drift back to the BJP (as happened in Haryana). The Maratha-Muslim-Mahar/Buddhist combination was a winner in the just held Lok Sabha elections. The BJP on the other hand will try and wean over the smaller groups amongst the SCs ( like the Matangs who have demanded their due share in reservations) with the Supreme Court allowing ‚Äúsub-classification‚Äù of castes within SC/ST quotas which will favour the smaller groups. On the face of it, there is no grand narrative discernible in this election in Maharashtra. Yet look below the surface and there is a sentiment there ‚Äì a sub-nationalistic emotion involving Marathi/Maratha/Maharashtrian pride. It manifested itself during the Maratha agitation for reservations, or when people hit the streets after the sexual assault against school children in Badlapur or when a badly constructed statue of Chhatrapati Shivaji collapsed in Sindhudurg district. Or the growing angst many feel at big projects being transferred to Gujarat at the expense of Maharashtra. Many eyes are on the 84-year-old Sharad Pawar. As the tallest and most experienced leader in the MVA ‚Äì and in Maharashtra ‚Äì with his extensive knowledge of every constituency, its caste matrix, familiarity with its leaders, his word is taken seriously by Uddhav Thackeray and Rahul Gandhi, and not ignored by other Congress leaders. This enabled him to get the better of his nephew Ajit Pawar in the Lok Sabha elections. Could this goodwill and sympathy and the hard nosed political strategy for which he is known make him an X factor in this election? In the Lok Sabha polls, it was Uddhav Thackeray who had generated greater sympathy. This time round, it is Pawar who is being hailed as the ‚Äú84 year old young man‚Ä¶ who won‚Äôt stop until he puts Maharashtra on the right path‚Äù. Many wait to see if he will come up with a trump card, as the campaign gets underway, to turn the tables in the MVA‚Äôs favour?","category":"politics"},{"publishedAt":"2024-10-22","title":"After Chandrababu Naidu, Tamil Nadu CM Stalin talks of larger families, links it to delimitation effect","description":"Referring to a potential reduction of South India‚Äôs share in parliamentary seats due to lower population growth rates, Stalin jokes: ‚ÄúWhy not aim for 16 children?‚Äù","urlToImage":"https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/10/stalin.jpg?w=640","content":"A REMARK made by Tamil Nadu Chief Minister M K Stalin in jest over couples and children, on the heels of his Andhra Pradesh counterpart N Chandrababu Naidu advising people to have more offspring, has renewed the debate over delimitation and its impact on southern states with their lower population indices. Speaking at a mass wedding ceremony organised of 31 couples by the Tamil Nadu Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments (HR&CE) Department in Chennai Monday, Stalin mentioned how blessings for newlyweds had changed over time, and went on to refer to an old Tamil saying from the book Manamakkalukku that enumerated 16 forms of wealth ‚Äì ranging from cows and land to children and education. Referring next to a potential reduction of South India‚Äôs share in parliamentary seats due to lower population growth rates, Stalin joked: ‚ÄúWhy not aim for 16 children?‚Äù On Saturday, Naidu warned against the effects on Andhra of an ageing population. Addressing a public gathering, he said his government was contemplating legislation to incentivise families to have more children, reversing earlier policies aimed at population control. The CM cautioned that a rise in the proportion of the elderly could strain the South‚Äôs economy, a phenomenon being experienced in many of the developed countries. He cited the examples of Japan, China, and parts of Europe, where ageing populations outnumber younger generations. ‚ÄúIn many villages, only elderly people remain as the young have migrated to cities or overseas,‚Äù Naidu said, citing that the fertility rate in southern states was well below the national average at 1.6. He promised legislation under which the government would provide benefits to families with more children. Where Naidu will strike a chord with his Southern counterparts is the threat implicit in his remarks regarding a fall in population numbers affecting the states‚Äô political influence. If population is the criterion for deciding constituency boundaries, the delimitation process, scheduled to occur after the new Census, would reduce the number of Lok Sabha seats in states like Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh. The DMK has also raised the unfairness of population numbers determining devolution of Central funds in Parliament, saying it ‚Äúpenalises‚Äù southern states for meeting population goals.","category":"politics"},{"publishedAt":"2024-10-22","title":"5 reasons why Congress, Uddhav Sena talks have hit a roadblock","description":"The Raut-Patole showdown and ‚Äúunreasonable‚Äù demands from the Sena (UBT) are some of the reasons cited by the two parties","urlToImage":"https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/10/Untitled-design-2-18.jpg?w=640","content":"The Congress and Shiv Sena (UBT) talks over seat-sharing for the coming Maharashtra polls has hit a hurdle, with both parties reaching out to NCP (SP) chief Sharad Pawar to try break the deadlock. After the Sena (UBT) threatened to walk out of the talks if state Congress chief Nana Patole participated in them, the Congress Sunday cancelled its Central Election Committee (CEC) meeting to finalise candidates. A senior Congress leader, who is a key negotiator in the talks, told The Indian Express that the demands raised by the Thackeray camp were ‚Äúunreasonable‚Äù and ‚Äúdifficult to accept‚Äù. So what is holding up the negotiations? Here are five factors: The Vidarbha tangle Sources said the Sena (UBT) has proposed a 100:100:88 seat-sharing formula for itself, Congress and the NCP (SP) respectively. ‚ÄúSmaller allies and other parties could be accommodated from each party‚Äôs share,‚Äù a Sena (UBT) leader said. The leader said Patole wanted 125 seats for the Congress and refused to concede seats to the Sena (UBT) in Vidarbha, leading to a showdown between him and Sena (UBT) MP Sanjay Raut at a meeting last week. According to sources, the Sena (UBT) sought seats where the Congress has a strong presence ‚Äî Ramtek and Dhamangaon Railway. Or where it won in 2019 ‚Äî Warora in Chandrapur, Daryapur in Amaravati, Bandra East and Nagpur South. Sena (UBT)‚Äôs LS ‚Äòsacrifice‚Äô The Sena (UBT) feels it sacrificed two Lok Sabha seats in Vidharbha ‚Äì Ramtek and Amaravati ‚Äì for the Congress in the Lok Sabha polls to honour ‚Äúalliance dharma‚Äù, and now wants the grand old party to return the favour for the coming polls. However, the Sena (UBT) has been told that it does not have strong candidates in the seats and will have to rely on imports. The Congress also pointed out that it had not sought a single seat in the Konkan belt, seen to be a Sena stronghold, as winnability should be the only criterion for seat-sharing. The Patole factor Sources said that Patole‚Äôs ‚Äúaggressive‚Äù behaviour at a meeting last week did not go down well with the Sena (UBT), which claimed it was unnecessary. The Maharashtra Congress chief‚Äôs demand for a seat in Nashik City also reportedly irked the Sena, which led to the Patole-Raut showdown and an inconclusive end to the meeting. Raut later threatened to stop talks if Patole took part in them. The Congress, however, said its state chief cannot be kept out of negotiations. Sena‚Äôs demand According to the Congress, the Sena (UBT) was pulling more than its weight by seeking 100 seats while its strength was limited to 80-85 seats. The grand old party feels giving them 15-20 seats more will reduce its chances of winning them and increasing its tally. The Matoshree meeting The Congress claims it was caught unawares by the ‚Äúurgent meeting‚Äù called by Uddhav Thackeray at his residence on Sunday, ‚Äúforcing‚Äù it to cancel its own Central Election Committee (CEC) meeting. It went to ask its Maharashtra leadership to stay back in Delhi, virtually ruling out seat-sharing talks for two days.","category":"politics"},{"publishedAt":"2024-10-22","title":"CPM, Congress raise the BJP bogey as Palakkad bypoll witnesses upheavals","description":"Left alleges Congress shifted Vadakara MP Shafi Parambil out of Palakkad as a part of its deal with BJP; Congress says its rebel P Sarin, who is being backed by Left from seat, was the one in touch with BJP","urlToImage":"https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/10/Left-to-right-2024-10-21T111738.011.jpg?w=640","content":"Even as the high-profile Wayanad Lok Sabha seat, vacated by Leader of the Opposition Rahul Gandhi, is set for bypolls, the Palakkad Assembly seat continues to hog the limelight, with the Congress and CPI(M) engaged in a blame game and accusing each other of ‚Äústriking a deal‚Äù with the BJP. Facing Opposition onslaught over the Thrissur Pooram festival row, that was followed by the BJP winning its first ever Lok Sabha seat in Kerala, the CPI(M) has now claimed that shifting sitting Congress MLA Shafi Parambil, whose Lok Sabha victory necessitated the November 13 Palakkad bypoll, to Vadakara was part of the Congress‚Äôs ‚Äúdeal with the BJP‚Äù. ‚ÄúSitting Vadakara MP K Muraleedharan was shifted to Thrissur while Parambil was fielded from Vadakara as part of the deal with the BJP, which then emerged as the runner-up in 2021. Now, the Congress wants to ensure a BJP victory there,‚Äù CPI(M) state secretary M V Govindan has said. The CPI(M) has also latched on to the statement by Congress rebel P Sarin, who also said last week that the Congress and BJP had struck a deal for the Vadakara Lok Sabha seat and now the Palakkad bypoll. Sarin knew ‚Äúinner secrets of the Congress‚Äù, the CPI(M) has said, referring to his high-profile position in the party. Lashing out at the CPI(M)‚Äôs claims, Leader of the Opposition in the Kerala Assembly V D Satheesan has, in turn, questioned the Left‚Äôs decision to back Sarin as an Independent candidate from Palakkad, after he rebelled against the Congress over denial of the bypoll ticket to him. The Congress leader said Sarin had first ‚Äúapproached the BJP for a nomination‚Äù. ‚ÄúWe did not pick Sarin as he previously held discussions with the BJP. The Opposition in Kerala unearthed the CPI(M)-BJP nexus,‚Äù Satheesan said. While Sarin walked into the CPI(M), which welcomed him with open arms, the BJP has fielded its state general secretary C Krishnakumar, who unsuccessfully contested the recent Lok Sabha polls as well as the 2016 Assembly elections, from Palakkad. The Congress has picked its state Youth Congress chief Ram Rahul Mamkoottathil. It is the first time in 40 years that the CPI(M) is backing an Independent in the Palakkad Assembly seat. Palakkad district is seen to be a Left bastion and has elected party veterans like A K Gopalan and E K Nayanar to the Lok Sabha from the Palakkad seat earlier. Former CM V S Achuthanandan had won the Malampuzha Assembly seat, which falls in the district, four times. However, in recent years, the BJP has been expanding in the district, mainly riding on its good performance in Malampuzha and Palakkad Assembly seats. By backing Sarin, the Left hopes to split the Congress votes in Palakkad, given that the party won by just 3,800 votes in 2021.","category":"politics"},{"publishedAt":"2024-10-22","title":"With Court bringing ‚Äòclosure‚Äô on Section 6A, focus in Assam shifts to NRC, and that CAA question","description":"Depending on their stand, civil groups demand that NRC be implemented, even if that requires verification. Opposition argues that after apex court verdict, it is clear CAA cannot be implemented in the state","urlToImage":"https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/10/october-32.jpg?w=640","content":"With the Supreme Court last week bringing to a close the long-standing debate in Assam by upholding Section 6A of the Citizenship Act, all eyes across state are now on the National Register of Citizens (NRC), which has been in limbo since 2019. Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma, who has in the past extended support to the 1951 cut-off to determine citizenship in Assam, on Friday summed up the differing views of the apex court ruling. ‚ÄúThe Supreme Court decision will not have any major impact on the state‚Äôs social life as it just reiterates what is already in place. However, many people wanted the cut-off to be 1951 but the (Assam) Accord laid it down to be 1971. Some things do not happen even if we want them to. There is unhappiness in a section of people that we will never get 1951 (as the cut-off) while a few others are happy that there is closure,‚Äù he told reporters in Ranchi. The plea in the apex court, apart from challenging the validity of Section 6A, sought 1951 as the cut-off for inclusion into the NRC as against the existing March 25, 1971. The NRC was published in 2019 but the Registrar General of India (RGI) is yet to notify it, with both the BJP-led Central and state governments maintaining that it is not acceptable in its current form. The Assam Public Works (APW), an NGO whose petition led to the Supreme Court-monitored NRC in the state, has also expressed its unhappiness with the exercise. ‚ÄúThe Court verdict opens the doors for pleas which are seeking a reverification of the NRC,‚Äù the NGO‚Äôs president Aabhijeet Sarma said. ‚ÄúNow that the matter has concluded in the apex court and the cut-off is 1971, our next step will be seeking reverification of the draft NRC. We have already filed a petition seeking 100% reverification in all 22 districts. We are waiting for the government to file an application. Everyone says they are unhappy with the NRC, they should file an application now,‚Äù Aabhijeet told The Indian Express. Critics of the 2019 NRC which include the APW, Assam government and All Assam Students‚Äô Union (AASU), allege that the process of the exercise is flawed as it excludes ‚Äúindigenous people‚Äù while including a large number of ‚Äúforeigners‚Äù. They also claim that the number of people who entered the state after the March 24, 1971, cut-off is far higher than 19 lakh ‚Äì the number of people excluded from the 2019 NRC. Also read | SC upholds Section 6A of Citizenship Act: what is the provision, why it was challenged Sarma has said that his government is in favour of 20% reverification in the districts that border Bangladesh and 10% in other districts. However, some differing opinions apart, the SC ruling was largely welcomed by political parties and civil society groups. Among those who hailed the ruling was the AASU, with its advisor Samujjal Chattacharya saying that the state and Central governments should approach the apex court seeking reverification of the NRC. ‚ÄúIt is now the duty of the state and Central governments to form a time-bound action plan to implement the Assam Accord. The ruling also lays bare the problem of illegal immigration into Assam and the problems restricting the influx of migrants after 1971, which was the main aim of the Assam Accord‚Ä¶ With regard to the NRC, the government must seek reverification now that the cut-off issue is closed. The people of Assam want results,‚Äù Bhattacharya said. With voices in support of reverification of the NRC growing, a lawyer who worked extensively on citizenship cases said the issue had been raised in the Supreme Court even before the 2019 NRC was finalised, but was dismissed. In July 2019, a Supreme Court Bench comprising then Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi and Justice Rohinton Fali Nariman had observed that NRC coordinator Prateek Hajela had submitted that 27% reverification had been done during the course of the exercise and further sample verification was not necessary. The All Assam Minority Students‚Äô Union (AAMSU), on the other hand, has welcomed the ‚Äúclosure‚Äù given by the apex court and urged the government to notify the 2019 NRC. ‚ÄúEven as the Assam Accord was accepted by all sections, we saw that some groups tried to push the state back into the 1980s by demanding a 1951 cut-off. We are not in support of foreigners. If anyone has illegally entered the country after 1971 ‚Äì be it Muslims or Hindus ‚Äì they should be pulled up without harassing Indian citizens. Those people included in the 2019 NRC must be given certificates and the government should take steps to deport those who did not make the cut,‚Äù AAMSU president Rejaul Karim said. Check out | Explained: What NRC CAA means to you The Opposition ‚Äì the Congress, Raijor Dol and Asom Jatiya Parishad ‚Äì is trying to use the Supreme Court ruling to question the government over another sticky law, the Citizenship (Amendment ) Act (CAA), which enables fast-tracking of citizenship for Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Jain, Parsi, or Christian migrants from Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Afghanistan who entered India before December 31, 2014. The CAA has faced staunch opposition in the Brahmaputra Valley region of the state, with allegations that it is in contradiction of the Assam Accord. ‚ÄúThe Assam government must take responsibility for removing those who have entered India after 1971, be it Hindu, Muslim, Christian, Jain or Parsi‚Ä¶ The Supreme Court ruling‚Äôs biggest takeaway is that the CAA cannot be implemented in Assam. Those opposed to the CAA must approach the apex court against it as the chances for a favourable verdict are bright,‚Äù Raijor Dal leader Akhil Gogoi said.","category":"politics"},{"publishedAt":"2024-10-22","title":"As MVA seat-sharing impasse continues, it is down to Sharad Pawar to break the deadlock","description":"Congress cancels Central Election Committee (CEC) meeting, asks its Maharashtra leaders to stay put in Delhi; party waiting for next moves of Shiv Sena (UBT)","urlToImage":"https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/10/mva-1.png?w=640","content":"On a day the BJP released its first list of 99 candidates for the Maharashtra Assembly polls, the deadlock over seat-sharing between the Congress and Shiv Sena (UBT), two of the three constituents of the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA), showed no signs of relenting even as Sharad Pawar, the leader of the third MVA party NCP (Sharadchandra Pawar), appeared to have been asked to play the mediator. Virtually ending the possibility of any seat-sharing talks on Sunday and Monday, the grand old party on Sunday cancelled its Central Election Committee (CEC) meeting to finalise candidates and urged the state leadership to stay put in Delhi as Sena (UBT) leaders huddled in the home of party chief Uddhav Thackeray, Matoshree, in Mumbai.

While we have a history of winning these seats, they do not have candidates here. The demands are unreasonable,‚Äù the Congress leader said. As Leader of the Opposition (LoP) in the Legislative Council Ambadas Danve of the Sena (UBT) emphasised that the meeting at Matoshree was called to finalise the party‚Äôs campaign strategy and said issues, if any, ‚Äúwould be resolved soon‚Äù, party MLA and former minister Aaditya Thackeray, Uddhav‚Äôs son held an impromptu meeting with Pawar. However, he refused to divulge the contents of the meeting. Later in the day, Raut and fellow party MP Anil Desai also met the NCP leader. Even as Desai said the MVA would hold a joint press conference on Monday, a senior Congress leader claimed that his party was not aware of any such event. The Congress too seemingly ‚Äúreached out‚Äù to Pawar with its MLA and former minister Naseem Khan saying, ‚ÄúIt was a regular meeting. We want the MVA to stay firm and ensure we return to power.

What Maharashtra data tells us","description":"In 2019, Asaduddin Owaisi's party influenced the outcome in 13 closely contested Assembly seats, with seven going to the BJP and its allies and six to the Congress-NCP coalition.","urlToImage":"https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/10/Asaduddin-Owaisi.jpg?w=640","content":"Primarily focused on representing Muslim interests, the Asaduddin Owaisi-led All India Majlis-e-Ittehad-ul-Muslimeen (AIMIM) plays a notable role in Maharashtra‚Äôs electoral landscape but is often accused by other Opposition parties of ‚Äúcutting votes‚Äù that ends up helping the BJP. However, electoral data suggests that the party‚Äôs actual impact on damaging the electoral prospects of these non-BJP parties may not be as significant as public perception indicates. In the 2019 Assembly elections, the AIMIM contested 44 seats, winning two and securing 1.34% of the total votes. This represented a notable improvement from 2014 in which the party contested 22 seats, won two, and garnered only 0.93% of the total votes. Despite AIMIM‚Äôs efforts to project itself as a disruptor of the electoral hold of so-called secular parties in the Muslim community, the data reveals that its overall influence remains relatively limited. The AIMIM in 2019 contested 44 constituencies, winning Malegaon and Dhule and finishing second in Aurangabad Central, Aurangabad East, Byculla, and Solapur City Central. The party‚Äôs influence was felt in 13 more constituencies, where it received more votes than the margin of victory. The BJP and its allies won seven of these 13 seats and six went to the Congress-NCP coalition. Why the AIMIM is struggling in Maharashtra The AIMIM made a notable entrance into Maharashtra‚Äôs political arena in 2014 with the unexpected victories of journalist-turned-politician Imtiaz Jaleel in Aurangabad Central and Byculla. Jaleel‚Äôs subsequent triumph in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, where he became the first Muslim to represent Aurangabad Central in 39 years, marked the peak of AIMIM‚Äôs performance in the state, particularly after its alliance with Prakash Ambedkar‚Äôs Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi (VBA). However, the party has since faced significant challenges, including the dissolution of its alliance with the VBA over seat-sharing disputes and the failure to retain both Aurangabad Central and Byculla in the 2019 Assembly elections. While AIMIM did win in Malegaon Central, aided by the former MLA Mufti Ismail‚Äôs substantial following, and clinched Dhule in a closely contested race‚Äîwhere an unexpected vote split among established political figures allowed the relatively unknown Faruk Shah to emerge victorious‚Äîthe party has struggled to build on these initial successes. The recent loss of Imtiaz Jaleel by over 1.30 lakh votes in the 2024 Aurangabad Lok Sabha seat raises critical questions about the party‚Äôs ongoing appeal among Muslim voters. It appears that the Muslim electorate has shifted its support toward parties more capable of effectively opposing the BJP. ALSO READ | As AIMIM reaches out in Maharashtra, Congress denies has got any offer Moreover, internal turmoil within AIMIM has surfaced, particularly following the sidelining of working president Gaffar Quadri and former Mumbai president Faiyyaz Ahmed. This discord has revealed deep rifts within the party, with many disgruntled leaders, including Quadri, accusing Jaleel of having a tacit understanding with the BJP. ‚ÄúI have all the information on how much money has been taken from the Shiv Sena and the BJP. Imtiaz Jaleel can‚Äôt fool the Muslim community for long,‚Äù Quadri asserted after learning his name was not being considered for the Assembly elections. The way forward To find its footing ahead of the Assembly elections, the AIMIM has been actively implementing a series of organisational changes and tweaking its political strategy. The party has proposed an alliance with the Congress and the NCP, suggesting collaboration in 28 seats. However, the Congress seems reluctant to accept this offer, with its social media wing recently amplifying accusations against former Aurangabad MP Imtiaz Jaleel that he had dealings with the BJP. Complicating matters, Jaleel has announced his intention not only to contest the Assembly elections but also to run in the Nanded Lok Sabha bypoll, necessitated by the death of Congress MP Vasantrao Chavan. The BJP lost Nanded this year despite the involvement of prominent local figures, including former CM Ashok Chavan, in the lead-up to the parliamentary polls. The Nanded parliamentary seat has a 14% Muslim population, which increases to 24% in Nanded city. The AIMIM made its initial electoral foray outside Hyderabad in Nanded and has established a substantial following there. However, Jaleel‚Äôs insistence on contesting an election in a constituency 300 km from his base in Aurangabad, rather than promoting local leaders, has raised eyebrows about the party‚Äôs political trajectory. ‚ÄúThe AIMIM entered the state‚Äôs electoral scene with considerable promise, capturing the attention of young community members who believed it could advocate for their rights. However, its recent political decisions have fueled doubts about whether its current path genuinely serves the community‚Äôs interests in asserting its rights within the broader political landscape of the country,‚Äù said activist Shaikh Ubaid Ba Hussain.","category":"politics"},{"publishedAt":"2024-10-22","title":"Today in Politics: Will MVA iron out seat-sharing differences and put up a united front?","description":"PM Modi to virtually inaugurate Rewa airport; Amit Shah to pay tribute to martyrs at National Police memorial","urlToImage":"https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/10/Left-to-right-2024-10-21T071215.001.jpg?w=640","content":"All eyes will be on the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) after Shiv Sena (UBT) MP, Anil Desai on Sunday said seat-sharing issues would be resolved soon and the coalition will hold a joint press conference on Monday.

Unlike his predecessors, Patole is known to speak his mind while attacking political opponents and expressing dissatisfaction with allies. Last week, Patole and Sena (UBT) MP Sanjay Raut were involved in a war of words over seat-sharing. While Raut called the state Congress leadership ‚Äúincapable‚Äù of taking decisions, Patole shot back and asked if the MP would take the decisions without consulting Thackeray, his party chief.

The 59-year-old Sakoli MLA and the Congress‚Äôs OBC face is now reportedly the party‚Äôs choice to be Chief Minister if the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) returns to power, given the support he enjoys from the Congress high command despite not having many friends in political circles as well as within the state unit. Patole was preferred as the chief of the Maharashtra Congress to inject vigour into the state leadership, which was unable to keep up with the aggressive allies such as the undivided Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and Shiv Sena. His clean image ‚Äî he is not facing any investigation by central agencies ‚Äî also seemed to work in his favour. While an ex-CM of the Congress said Patole was picked as a compromise candidate between two warring factions of the party, a former executive member of the state unit claimed his aggressive attacks on the BJP and popularity with party workers earned him goodwill. A four-time MLA, Patole made his electoral debut in 1990 when he won the Zilla Parishad polls. His big break came in 1999 after he was first elected as the Lakhandur MLA in 1999 as the Congress‚Äôs candidate. He crossed over to the BJP in 2009 and successfully contested the 2014 Lok Sabha polls against former Union Minister Praful Patel on the latter‚Äôs home turf of Bhandara-Gondia. Patole was forced to return to the Congress in December 2017 after he spoke out against the ‚Äúanti-farmer‚Äù policies of the BJP and Prime Minister Narendra Modi following which he unsuccessfully contested the 2019 Lok Sabha polls against Union Minister Nitin Gadkari from Nagpur. He later won the Assembly polls from Sakoli in Bhandara district. His stint as Speaker was also eventful. As Speaker, he took up a suo motu breach of privilege motion against then Chief Secretary Ajoy Mehta in 2020 for allegedly not responding to a communication from the legislature. Days before he resigned as Speaker the following year, Patole urged MLAs to formulate a law to give voters the option of choosing between Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) and ballot papers in local body and Assembly polls and also tabled a suo motu resolution on caste census.

Khotkar had distanced himself from Pangarkar after the Karnataka SIT arrested the latter in August 2018, according to party insiders.

First, the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) openly disagreed with the seat-distribution formula, calling it ‚Äúunilateral‚Äù. The Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) and the Congress are also heading towards a deadlock over some constituencies, with disagreements between them over the latter‚Äôs demand to give the RJD more seats from the JMM quota. Chief Minister Hemant Soren on Saturday announced that his party and the Congress would contest 70 of the 81 seats in the state, with the rest for the other coalition partners. Hours later, RJD MP Manoj Jha said the decision was ‚Äúunilateral‚Äù and sought more tickets. Jha told reporters in Ranchi that ‚Äúless than 12-13 seats‚Äù was not acceptable to his party, claiming that the RJD has a stronghold in 18-20 constituencies. ‚ÄúOur sole aim is to defeat the BJP, we will not sabotage the INDIA bloc,‚Äù said the Rajya Sabha MP, adding that even if the party decides to go solo in the elections, it will back the Opposition alliance‚Äôs candidates in 60-62 constituencies. On the deadlock between the Congress and the JMM over some seats, sources in the latter said Soren was miffed with the Congress central leadership. ‚ÄúHemant Soren had a conversation with Congress general secretary for organisation K C Venugopal and there were certain disagreements over seat-sharing, with the latter asking that the RJD be given more seats from JMM‚Äôs quota. The conversation did not end on a happy note.‚Äù Sources said as per the agreed-upon formula, the JMM was supposed to get 50 seats and accommodate Left parties from its quota. The remaining 31 were to go to the Congress, with the RJD expected to get its share from the grand old party‚Äôs slice of the pie.‚ÄúThe RJD is talking without any basis, leading to issues. It is calculating runners-up, but we are seeing winners and they won one seat. If the Congress wants to accommodate RJD, then they should do it from their quota. Nationally, the RJD and the Congress are allies. Why bother the JMM, a regional party?‚Äù asked a JMM leader. ALSO READ | ‚ÄòPlease get us Kalpana‚Äô: The growing profile of Mrs Hemant Soren Another JMM source said in the 2020 Bihar Assembly elections, the party had demanded three seats, including the Scheduled Tribe (ST) reserved seat of Katoria. ‚ÄúHowever, the RJD did not budge and now they want us to accommodate them,‚Äù said the leader, adding that the differences would ‚Äúeventually be resolved‚Äù. Of the 70 seats for which a deal has been struck, 41 are expected to go to the JMM and 29 to the Congress. However, with the RJD matter popping up, the complexities have increased. Sources said the Congress state leadership was in New Delhi to discuss the matter with the party‚Äôs high command. ‚ÄúWith the Haryana elections not being in our favour, the JMM is arm-twisting us. For instance, BJP‚Äôs sitting MLA from Jamua, Kedar Hazra, and AJSUP‚Äôs Uma Kant Rajak from Chandankyari joined the JMM and they will be fielded. First, these BJP leaders approached Congress but the JMM was quick enough to make deals with them,‚Äù said a Congress leader. Sources said while a high-profile seat such as Ranchi was expected to go to the JMM, some Congress leaders had laid a claim on it. In the Bhawnathpur constituency, former Congress MLA and former BJP leader Anant Pratap Deo has now joined the JMM and sources said it was likely he would get the ticket. ‚ÄúThis is going out of our hands,‚Äù said a local Congress leader. ‚ÄúAnant Pratap Deo quit the Congress to join the BJP and now the JMM is set to reward him with a ticket. This is against the coalition dharma and has been communicated to the state leadership of our party. It seems that we have become the JMM‚Äôs second fiddle.‚Äù Sources said local party workers had written to senior leader Rahul Gandhi‚Äôs office about how this had demoralised them. ‚ÄúManas Sinha, former working president of the Jharkhand Pradesh Congress Committee had been working in the seat for the last 10 years building organisation. Instead, the seat was given to a former Congress leader who insulted the party and joined the BJP and now he is in the JMM. This has led to a widespread slump in the cadre morale,‚Äù said a Congress leader. Congress leaders said in the last election the party did not contest in six districts and the Bhawnathpur and Jamua seats had gone to the JMM. This time, the party is set to lose out on contesting from eight districts, they added. Bhawnathpur, a Congress leader said, borders Bihar, Chhattisgarh, and Uttar Pradesh and giving up on the seat sends a message to party workers in all three states. A senior Congress leader said that given the deadlock, the party would have to reduce its expectation from 29 to 25 seats. ‚ÄúIf this happens, then our desperation will be clear. The Congress should have also played hard as it is Hemant Soren who wants to be the CM,‚Äù the leader said.

But despite the several rows he gets involved in, the seven-time MLA continues to remain an integral part of the party in the northern state.","urlToImage":"https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/10/anil-vij.jpg?w=640","content":"Unhappy with Nayab Singh Saini being made Haryana Chief Minister earlier this year, Anil Vij walked out of a BJP legislature party meeting in a huff, got into his car, and drove back to his home in Ambala Cantonment and refused to attend the swearing-in ceremony. This was back in March and seven months down the line, Vij on October 17 took oath as a minister of the new Saini Cabinet, with the party having returned to power for a historic third straight term. Vij‚Äôs return shows his consummate political survival skills and why he is seemingly indispensable to the BJP in Haryana despite landing both himself and the party in a spot several times in the past due to various remarks, style of functioning, and his hot-and-cold relationship with both Saini and his predecessor and current Union Minister Manohar Lal Khattar. BJP insiders said the key reason for the minister‚Äôs continued importance to the party was his hold on the Ambala Cantonment seat that he won seven times so far, winning four straight times since 2009. Among his voters, he has an image of a ‚Äúmost accessible leader who takes care of their issues‚Äù, irrespective of any department, be it the police, revenue, or urban local bodies. Known for his ‚Äúon-the-spot‚Äù redress of people‚Äôs grievances, Vij used to hold regular Janata Darbars (public hearing sessions) at his home in Ambala. A key political player in state politics for decades, Vij‚Äôs sphere of influence extends to the larger Ambala division that has 18 Assembly constituencies. Though the BJP swept the region in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, taking a lead in all 18 Assembly segments, it won only nine in the Assembly elections a few months down the line and again took the lead in only nine Assembly segments in this year‚Äôs parliamentary polls. In the recent Assembly elections, the Congress outperformed the BJP in this region, winning 12 seats while the rest went to the latter. Without Vij, it will be difficult for the BJP to break the Congress hold in this region. Run-ins with Khattar Vij, however, has not been someone the BJP has been able to keep in check in the past, with the root of his discontentment being his rivalry with Khattar. In October 2023, the minister hit the headlines for directing the police top brass to suspend 372 investigating officers for not taking action on pending complaints for more than one year. More than 100 officers subsequently faced suspension. A month later, he stopped clearing files and chairing the Health Department‚Äôs meetings in protest against ‚Äúinterference by the chief minister‚Äôs office (CMO) officials‚Äù. Don't miss | 32 votes and 12 Independents: How Haryana‚Äôs closest battle played out, was won by BJP In December 2020, Vij and Khattar were at loggerheads over the intelligence wing. Vij who held the Home portfolio insisted that besides the CM he should also receive regular briefings from state intelligence officials. Eventually, both met the party‚Äôs central leadership in Delhi and the intelligence wing of the CID went to Khattar. Subsequently, Vij also lost two key departments, technical education and science and technology, as both were merged with the Department of Higher Education, which came under then minister Mool Chand Sharma. In the run-up to the Assembly polls, Vij underlined that he would stake claim to the CM post, citing his seniority. ‚ÄúAgli mulaqat ab Mukhyamantri awaas par hogi (I shall meet you all next at CM‚Äôs residence),‚Äù he told reporters during an interaction. He has appeared to have softened his position since the results. ‚ÄúI never said that I wanted to become the CM. Rather, a few people spread lies that Anil Vij is shy of responsibility. I only said that if the party wants me to be the CM, I shall do my duty diligently. I am a committed soldier of the BJP and whatever responsibility my party will give me, I shall fulfil it,‚Äù he said. Born on March 15, 1953, in Ambala Cantonment, Vij worked in a nationalised bank for a few years and over four decades ago shifted to politics with the help of Sushma Swaraj who twice won from Ambala Cantonment, in 1977 and 1987. In 1990, when Swaraj was elected to the Rajya Sabha, she asked Vij to resign from his bank job and contest the bypoll for the BJP. This launched Vij‚Äôs political career and the following year, he was appointed the Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha‚Äôs state president.","category":"politics"},{"publishedAt":"2024-10-22","title":"Crucial piece in Maharashtra puzzle, how BJP is trying to regain lost ground in onion belt","description":"Farmers' unrest and Muslim, Maratha votes will be important in the battle for north Maharashtra‚Äôs 35 Assembly seats.","urlToImage":"https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/10/maharashtra-north.jpg?w=640","content":"For years, north Maharashtra has been a BJP stronghold and one of the major drivers of its rise in the state. Despite a strong RSS network, the party knows that this region, comprising the Nashik, Jalgaon, Dhule and Nandurbar districts, and accounting for six Lok Sabha and 35 Assembly constituencies, cannot be taken for granted in the coming Assembly elections because of unrest among farmers and a Muslim-Maratha consolidation against it. In the recent Lok Sabha polls, the BJP, which is part of the ruling Mahayuti alliance, took a beating in north Maharashtra. Anti-incumbency, coupled with the anger among farmers, damaged the party in the region. In next month‚Äôs Assembly polls, north Maharashtra will test the BJP‚Äôs ability to ride the challenges to retain its hold on the area, along with alliance partners Shiv Sena and Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), against its rivals in the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA), which is made up of the Shiv Sena (UBT) of Uddhav Thackeray, the NCP (SP) of Sharad Pawar, and the Congress. In the 2019 Assembly polls, the BJP emerged as the leader in the region, with wins in 13 constituencies, followed by the undivided Sena at six, the undivided NCP at seven, the Congress at five, and the AIMIM at two, with the remaining two seats going to Independents. The recent Lok Sabha elections for the region‚Äôs six parliamentary seats saw the Congress and BJP win two each, and the NCP (SP) and Shiv Sena (UBT) win one each. Five years earlier, it was total NDA dominance as the BJP won five seats and the Sena one. Taking lessons from its poor Lok Sabha outcome, the Mahayuti has taken several course corrective measures to undo the damage, especially in the onion belt. In December 2023, the Narendra Modi government at the Centre banned the export of onions to tackle domestic supply issues and ensure steady prices. Before the ban, it had imposed a 40% export duty on onions. The export ban continued till April-end before being lifted on May 4, in the middle of the Lok Sabha elections. Later, on September 13, the Centre reduced the export duty on onions from 40% to 20%, a move aimed at diffusing the unrest among farmers and boosting their incomes. In the 2019 Assembly polls, the BJP emerged as the leader in the region, with wins in 13 constituencies, followed by the undivided Sena at six, the undivided NCP at seven, the Congress at five, and the AIMIM at two, with the remaining two seats going to Independents. The flip-flop on onion exports turned farmers in north Maharashtra, which accounts for 30% of the country‚Äôs onion production, against the Mahayuti. To what extent the corrective measures help the BJP reverse its losses in this belt remains something to watch out for. The BJP has its task cut out as Sharad Pawar‚Äôs strategy is to exploit farmers‚Äô unrest for the Opposition alliance‚Äôs benefit. The Maratha quota agitation led by activist Manoj Jarange Patil, which has turned against the BJP, will also be a factor to some extent in the region. However, BJP MLA and state Rural Development Minister Girish Mahajan, who has represented the Jamner Assembly constituency for six consecutive terms from 1995 to 2019, said, ‚ÄúIn the Assembly elections, we will do much better in north Maharashtra. Reducing export duty on onions and free electricity for farmers have given them major relief.‚Äù Religious polarisation In the last six months, the Mahayuti‚Äôs high-decibel Hindutva agenda has also found resonance in north Maharashtra, where Nashik, a major Hindu pilgrimage centre, is located. Right-wing and affiliated outfits are using the ‚ÄúHindu khatre mein hain (Hindus are in danger)‚Äù slogan to counter the alleged consolidation of Muslims in favour of the MVA. The undercurrent of religious polarisation is set to be a crucial factor in this election. Alleging Muslim consolidation against the Mahayuti, Deputy Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis last month warned of ‚Äúvote jihad‚Äù. Fadnavis cited the result in the Dhule Lok Sabha seat, where despite leading in five of its six Assembly segments, BJP candidate Subash Bhamre lost by under 4,000 votes to the Congress‚Äôs Shobha Bacchav, who polled 1.98 lakh votes in the Malegaon Central segment alone. Though polling data does not support the BJP‚Äôs narrative, party insiders said polarisation was the only way to get a majority of Hindu votes. When Mahant Ramgiri Maharaj, a religious leader, made anti-Islam remarks in August, the government‚Äôs response was seen as soft. CM Eknath Shinde shared a dais with Ramgiri Maharaj 48 hours later and praised him for serving people. Though FIRs were filed, the religious leader was not arrested. In September, after news spread of his controversial remarks, BJP MLA Nitesh Rane threatened to ‚Äúenter mosques to beat up Muslims‚Äù if anybody dared speak against Ramgiri Maharaj. Big names who may contest Among the prominent leaders in this region who are likely to contest the Assembly polls is NCP (SP) leader Eknath Khadse, who ended his four-decade-long association with the BJP to join the then undivided NCP in 2020. However, during the recent Lok Sabha polls, Khadse announced he was returning to the BJP and campaigned for its candidates, including his daughter-in-law Raksha Khadse, who contested and won the Raver parliamentary constituency and is now a Union Minister of State. However, after the BJP did not reinduct him into the party and appoint him Governor, Khadse earlier this year joined the NCP (SP), which is likely to field his daughter and the party‚Äôs women‚Äôs wing chief Rohini Khadse from Muktainagar. The region will have some well-established leaders contesting the polls, including the Ajit Pawar-led NCP‚Äôs OBC leader Chhagan Bhujbal, who is likely to contest from Yeola, which he has won in consecutive elections since 2004. The Shiv Sena is also likely to field at least two ministers in north Maharashtra, Dada Bhuse from Malegaon Outer and Gulabrao Patil in Jalgaon Rural.","category":"politics"},{"publishedAt":"2024-10-22","title":"Rajasthan bypoll: Minister Kirodi‚Äôs brother, party rebels on BJP‚Äôs list of candidates","description":"Former BJP MLA Rajendra Gurjar (Deoli Uniara) and Revant Ram Danga (Khinvsar) were also announced as party candidates.

Following the loss of some Lok Sabha seats in eastern Rajasthan this year, Kirodi Lal Meena had submitted his resignation as a cabinet minister, claiming ‚Äúmoral responsibility‚Äù for the losses. However, some in the party had suspected sabotage by Kirodi in Dausa as he is said to have been hoping for a ticket for his brother Jagmohan but the party opted for Kanhaiya Lal Meena, who lost the election.

An RSS member, Jagmohan retired as a Rajasthan Administrative Service (RAS) officer. As for Jhunjhunu, denied a ticket by the party in 2023 elections, Rajendra Singh Bhamboo had rebelled and contested as an independent but stood third behind Congress‚Äôs Brijendra Singh Ola and Nisheet Kumar alias Bablu Choudhary. This time, the party has opted for Bhamboo instead of Bablu. Similarly, the party has opted for 2023 rebel Sukhvant Singh in Ramgarh. Since 1990, this seat has shifted between the Khan family of Congress and Gyan Dev Ahuja of BJP. Congress leader Zubair Khan was first elected from here in 1990 and again in 1993, 2003 and 2023. Ahuja won the seat in 1998, 2008, and 2013, but was dropped in 2018, allegedly owing to his differences with then CM Vasundhara Raje. The Congress also dropped Khan, and instead fielded his wife Shafia Zubair, who defeated Sukhvant Singh of BJP. Last year, the Congress had dropped Shafia for her husband, who passed away last month. In 2023, the BJP had fielded Gyan Dev‚Äôs relative Jai Ahuja, who had stood third, while Sukhavant Singh had contested as an Aazad Samaj Party (Kanshi Ram) candidate and polled over 74,000 votes and stood second. In Deoli-Uniara too, the BJP has dropped its 2023 candidate, Vijay Bainsla, son of late Gujjar agitation leader Kirori Bainsla, instead opting for former MLA Rajendra Gurjar (2013-18), who was defeated by Harish Meena in 2018. Rajendra had sought a ticket again in 2023 but the party opted for Vijay Bainsla. Revant Ram Danga is the only candidate in the BJP‚Äôs list who has been repeated from 2023 elections. In one of the most closely watched and controversial election from 2023 polls, Danga had lost to Rashtriya Loktantrik Party chief Hanuman Beniwal by just 2,059 votes in Khinvsar, once considered the RLP stronghold as it has remained in Beniwal family since the first election here in 2008. Of the seven bypoll seats, only Salumber, a tribal seat, was with the BJP. Here, Amrit Lal Meena was the party‚Äôs sitting MLA, having won the seat in 2013, 2018 and 2023. Hoping to ride the sympathy wave, the BJP has fielded his wife Shanta Devi Meena from here.

At the same time, it is working out strategies to prevent the ticket allocation troubles that sealed its fate in the Haryana polls. The Congress has sent out signals that it does not want to repeat the same ‚Äúmistakes‚Äù that it made in Haryana.

Also Read | MVA talks hit a stalemate; Sena (UBT) wants Maharashtra Congress chief Nana Patole ‚Äòkept out‚Äô ‚ÄúDuring meetings, it has been discussed that we cannot let things go the way they did in Haryana. In Maharashtra, the AICC wants to be more involved in managing the state leadership and especially the aspiring candidates,‚Äù said a senior leader. Another leader, who has already begun campaign work in Maharashtra, said the party would follow an ‚Äúobjective method for ticket allocation‚Äù. ‚ÄúWe will not let tickets be decided by affiliation with top leaders like it happened in Haryana. The one and only criteria will be the winnability of a candidate. And those who can‚Äôt get tickets in the state will be managed by the top AICC leadership,‚Äù said the leader, adding that the party would make all attempts to ensure that those who are denied tickets do not turn rebels and contest as independent candidates. In Haryana, rebel candidates who were denied party tickets and went on to contest as Independents impacted the Congress‚Äôs prospects adversely. The defeats of the party‚Äôs official candidates in several seats were also attributed to them as they ended up cutting their votes. On Wednesday, Chief Minister Eknath Shinde and Deputy Chief Ministers Devendra Fadnavis and Ajit Pawar ‚Äî who are leaders of the Shiv Sena, BJP and NCP respectively ‚Äî jointly presented a report card of their Mahayuti coalition government. After the Lok Sabha polls, when the Mahayuti tally was 17 seats as against the MVA‚Äôs 30, the Shinde government announced a financial assistance scheme for women to consolidate the Mahayuti‚Äôs vote bank. As a counter to this, the Congress is also looking to quickly launch its five guarantees and manifesto in the state. There is a feeling among the party top brass that its Haryana manifesto was released later than it should have been, with lesser time to take the party narrative to the people. ‚ÄúThe party is considering five guarantees for the Maharashtra people ‚Äì where we will make certain promises to the electorate like cash payments to households, free bus travel for women, free 10 kg grains, cheaper power, and an unemployment allowance. We will also have the promise for caste census in our manifesto,‚Äù said an AICC leader. Also Read | Three major MVA constituents to be allotted less than 100 seats each: Sanjay Raut A senior Congress leader said that Gandhi doesn‚Äôt want to make guarantees ‚Äúpractical‚Äù. ‚ÄúThere is some pressure from allies too about the guarantees, but Rahul ji wants the guarantees to be absolutely practical so the party doesn‚Äôt lose face in the long run. I think a middle ground will be reached over the guarantees,‚Äù said the leader, considered close to Gandhi. The Congress‚Äôs guarantees had first helped the party taste success in the Himachal Pradesh elections in 2022. A similar template was then replicated in Telangana (2023) and Karnataka (2023) ‚Äî both states where the party ended up winning. On the issue of caste calculations, the Congress doesn‚Äôt want to repeat in Mahrashtra its Harana mistake ‚Äì relying too much on one community (Jats) ‚Äì which resulted in polarisation against the community and consolidation of other OBC and Dalit communities in favour of the BJP. ‚ÄúWe will focus our campaign on the Constitution and caste census. That worked for us in the Lok Sabha elections in Maharashtra and it will ensure a win for us once again,‚Äù said a Maharashtra Congress leader. AICC secretary in charge of Maharashtra Kunal Chaudhary told The Indian Express that the elections in the state will be fought over ‚Äúthe ideology of Jyotirao Phule, Dr Ambedkar and Shahuji Maharaj as against the ideology of Manusmriti being followed by the BJP‚Äù. ‚ÄúWe are fighting these elections for Dalits, Backward Classes and those who have been marginalised,‚Äù he said. Congress spokesperson Subharansh Kumar Rai said the biggest issue the Congress will rely on in the Maharashtra polls will be corruption and the ‚Äústolen mandate‚Äù by the Shinde government, referring to the leader‚Äôs June 2022 rebellion that split the Uddhav Thackeray-led undivided Shiv Sena.","category":"politics"},{"publishedAt":"2024-10-22","title":"BJP‚Äôs first list of 66 Jharkhand candidates: Ex-CMs, their kin to new faces and turncoats","description":"Babulal Marandi, Champai Soren, Sita Soren, Geeta Koda are among prominent BJP candidates, even as the party denies tickets to four sitting MLAs","urlToImage":"https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/10/champai-babulal1.jpg?w=640","content":"Two former Jharkhand chief ministers ‚Äì including the state‚Äôs first CM Babulal Marandi and former Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) leader Champai Soren ‚Äì are among the 66 candidates declared by the BJP Saturday for the forthcoming Assembly elections. The BJP released its first candidates‚Äô list a day after announcing on Friday its seat-sharing deal with its allies, which include the All Jharkhand Students‚Äô Union Party (AJSUP), Janata Dal (United) and Lok Janshakti Party (Ram Vilas). While the BJP is contesting 68 seats out of the state‚Äôs total 81 seats, the AJSU is contesting 10, the JD(U) two and the LJP one. Among the most prominent names in the BJP‚Äôs list is Marandi, Jharkhand‚Äôs first CM after the state was founded in 2000, who is now the state party chief. He will contest from Dhanwar, a seat he had won in the 2019 polls as the candidate of the Jharkhand Vikas Morcha (JVM), a party he founded in 2006 after quitting the BJP. Marandi merged the JVM with the BJP in 2020. Champai briefly served as the CM after JMM leader Hemant Soren stepped down from this post in January this year. Hemant was arrested by the Enforcement Directorate on alleged money laundering charges. Champai later resigned from the JMM to join the BJP weeks after Hemant again took over as the CM in July following his release from jail on bail. Champai will contest from Seraikela, a seat he has won in four consecutive polls since 2005. The 67-year-old leader‚Äôs entry into the BJP was seen as a significant boost for the party‚Äôs efforts to strengthen its connection with the Scheduled Tribes (ST), a strong support base of the ruling JMM. Champai was also able to negotiate a seat for his son Babulal Soren, who will contest from Ghatshila. Purnima Sahu, the daughter-in-law of Odisha Governor and former Jharkhand CM Raghubar Das, will contest from Jamshedpur East. Das, the only Jharkhand CM to have completed a full term, had represented the seat for five consecutive terms since 1995 until he lost to then Independent Saryu Roy in the 2019 polls. Former CM and ruling JMM co-founder Shibu Soren‚Äôs daughter-in-law Sita Soren will fight on the BJP ticket from Jamtara, a general seat currently held by the Congress. Though Sita Soren is a former three-time JMM MLA from Jama ‚Äì an ST-reserved seat ‚Äì since she was born in Odisha and is not a domiciled resident of Jharkhand, the BJP decided to field her from Jamtara to avoid any controversy at a later stage. Former Congress leader and Singhbhum MP Geeta Koda, wife of the ex-CM Madhu Koda ‚Äì who was convicted in a coal scam case in 2017 ‚Äì will contest from Jagannathpur, which Geeta and Madhu have each represented for two terms, and is now held by the Congress. Both husband and wife had joined the BJP ahead of the Lok Sabha elections, in which Geeta lost to the JMM‚Äôs Joba Majhi from the Singhbhum constituency. Former Dumka MP Sunil Soren, who was denied the Lok Sabha ticket, will contest the Dumka Assembly seat. Dumka was one of two seats won by Hemant Soren in 2019, and was won by his brother Basant in a 2020 bypoll after the CM vacated the seat. Former Rajya Sabha MP Sameer Oraon and ex-Union minister Sudarshan Bhagat will contest the Bishunpur and Gumla seats, respectively. Bhagat had won the Gumla Assembly seat in 2000. Of its 25 MLAs who had won in the 2019 polls, the BJP denied tickets to four ‚Äì from the Simaria, Kanke, Jamua, Sindri Assembly constituencies ‚Äì fielding 19 sitting legislators again. It has also given tickets to a slew of party veterans, new faces and turncoats. Jharkhand will go to polls in two phases on November 13 and November 20. The results will be announced on November 23.","category":"politics"},{"publishedAt":"2024-10-22","title":"Gauri Lankesh case accused joins Shinde Sena ahead of Maharashtra polls, gets charge of¬†Jalna¬†campaign","description":"On Friday, Pangarkar joined the Shinde Sena in the presence of party leader and former state minister Arjun Khotkar, who said he (Pangarkar) has been given charge of the party's poll campaign in Jalna Assembly constituency.","urlToImage":"https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/10/lankesh-accused-2col1.jpg?w=640","content":"An accused in the 2017 murder of journalist Gauri Lankesh has joined the Shiv Sena led by Maharashtra Chief Minister Eknath Shinde ahead of the Assembly elections in the state. Shrikant Pangarkar, who was arrested in August 2018 in the Lankesh case, was granted bail by the Karnataka High Court last month. He is also an accused in the 2018 Nalasopara arms haul case, in which he was granted bail earlier.¬†Both the cases are under trial. On Friday, Pangarkar joined the Shinde Sena in the presence of party leader and former state minister Arjun Khotkar, who said he (Pangarkar) has been given charge of the party‚Äôs poll campaign in Jalna Assembly constituency. ‚ÄúPangarkar is a former Shiv Sainik and has returned to the party. He has been given responsibility of the Jalna Vidhan Sabha poll campaign‚Ä¶ He has been working for the party. He has been released by the court and has come out of jail after completing the judicial proceedings,‚Äù said Khotkar, who is likely to contest the Assembly elections. Asked if Pangarkar would get a party ticket, Khotkar said he would work for the party in Jalna. When contacted, the Shinde Sena‚Äôs spokesperson and MLA, Sanjay Shirsat, however, said he was not aware of Pangarkar joining the party. Pangarkar was Jalna municipal councillor of the undivided Shiv Sena between 2001and 2006. After he was dropped by the party during the 2011 civic elections, he joined the Hindu Janjagruti Samiti.

In the arms haul case ‚Äî pistols, airguns and crude bombs were seized in Maharashtra‚Äôs Nallasopara in August 2018 ‚Äî the ATS claimed that Pangarkar had facilitated the funding for procuring the weapons. The 12 accused arrested, including Pangarkar, were charged with plotting attacks. The ATS claimed that the accused had conspired to disrupt the Sunburn music festival held in Pune in December 2017 by throwing petrol bombs, because they felt that it was against Hindu culture. They dropped the plan after an accused found himself exposed to a CCTV camera at the venue, it said. The ATS also claimed that the 12 accused had conducted recce of the homes of some prominent persons. The ATS filed a chargesheet in December 2018. Pangarkar and the others were charged under the anti-terror law Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, Explosive Substances Act, Arms Act and Maharashtra Police Act. On July 30 this year, the Bombay High Court granted Pangarkar and four others bail on the ground that the trial was underway, but the possibility of its timely completion appeared bleak. Lankesh was shot dead outside her residence in Bengaluru on September 5, 2017. A Karnataka police SIT arrested 17 persons linked to the Sanatan Sanstha and other outfits for the murder. Eleven of the 17 accused have been granted bail while the case has been under trial. Earlier this month, two key accused in the Lankesh case, including the alleged shooter, were felicitated by members of Hindutva groups in the Vijayapura region of Karnataka after they were released on bail.","category":"politics"},{"publishedAt":"2024-10-22","title":"After demanding seat-sharing talks in MVA, SP takes lead in declaring 5 candidates in Maharashtra","description":"SP president Akhilesh Yadav announced the name of Irshad Jageerdar as the party candidate from Dhule City during a public meeting in Dhule on Saturday.","urlToImage":"https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/10/akhilesh-new-4cols.jpg?w=640","content":"DAYS AFTER asking the Congress and other constituents of the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) not to release their list of candidates without discussing with it, the Samajwadi Party (SP) has announced its candidates on five seats in Maharashtra at different public meetings in the state. SP president Akhilesh Yadav announced the name of Irshad Jageerdar as the party candidate from Dhule City during a public meeting in Dhule on Saturday. On Friday, during a ‚ÄòPDA (Pichda, Dalit and Alpsankhyak) Jansabha‚Äô in Malegaon, Akhilesh declared that sitting MLAs Abu Asim Azmi and Rais Shaikh will be the party‚Äôs candidates from Mankhurd Shivaji Nagar and Bhiwandi East seats respectively. He also announced Riyaz Azmi as the SP candidate from Bhiwandi West and Shaan-e-Hind from Malegaon Central. Speaking to the media in Dhulia, Akhilesh said,¬†‚ÄúThis announcement (of candidates) has been made because they are doing good work here. At least the strength of our party can be seen‚Ä¶ Ever since the election dates have been announced, our party is on the ground. We do not want any delay this time.‚Äù He said the SP has demanded 12 seats in Maharashtra. ‚ÄúWe have our two MLAs here‚Ä¶ We are those people who get satisfied with lesser seats as well‚Ä¶ Yesterday we were in Malegaon‚Ä¶ We have declared seats where the party is strong,‚Äù said Akhilesh. The other seats the SP is eyeing as part of the MVA are Raver and Amravati, where the Congress has sitting MLAs, Byculla, Versova, Aurangabad East, Anushakti Nagar and Karanja. In the 2019 Assembly polls, the SP had contested on seven seats and won two. Speaking to¬†The Indian Express, Azmi, who is the state SP chief, said the announcement of his and Rais Shaikh‚Äôs name was certain. About the other three candidates, he said,¬†‚ÄúIn a survey it has been found that the SP candidate is best in Bhiwandi West seat. The other two seats (Malegaon Central and Dhule City) were won by AIMIM (in 2019) because of Muslim votes. (Here) SP influence among minorities is more than that of AIMIM. Also there are north Indian voters who can support SP because of Akhilesh Yadav. If SP contests on these seats in alliance with the Congress, Shiv Sena (UBT) and NCP (SP), that will develop a strong position for us there,‚Äù Azmi said. He said he had discussed the names of the SP candidates on the five seats with Congress, Shiv Sena (UBT), NCP (SP) and they ‚Äúdid not object to any of them‚Äù.Azmi also said the SP should get a few more seats in MVA. THe SP leader had earlier this week said that the Congress should take the SP into confidence before releasing its list of candidates and urged that a decision on seat-sharing be taken at the earliest. On Wednesday, he posted on X that it would be wrong for any of the MVA parties to release the list ‚Äúwithout talking to the SP‚Äù. There was no immediate reaction from any of the MVA constituents on the SP‚Äôs announcement of candidates in Maharashtra. Last week, a day after the Congress lost the Haryana Assembly elections, the SP had named candidates for six of the 10 Assembly seats in Uttar Pradesh where bypolls are scheduled next month.

Jain, who had been booked by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) on corruption charges in 2017, was arrested by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) for alleged money laundering through multiple firms allegedly linked to him and his family members ‚Äì charges dismissed as ‚Äúbaseless‚Äù by the AAP ‚Äì in May 2022. On Friday, Jain walked out of Tihar jail hours after a Delhi court granted him bail. One of the most prominent AAP ministers in Delhi in the then seven-member Arvind Kejriwal Cabinet prior to his arrest ‚Äì he held portfolios of health, power, home, public works department and urban development among others ‚Äì Jain‚Äôs release, AAP insiders said, came as a shot in the arm for it ahead of the Delhi Assembly elections due early next year, but what it means politically for Jain himself remains unclear at the moment. ‚ÄúDelhi‚Äôs hospitals were getting 18,000 more beds, there is no country in the world where the expansion of government hospitals was being taken up at such a scale. If this had been achieved, (the BJP) would have got exposed in front of the people. That is why Satyendar Jain was arrested, so that work meant for the people does not get accomplished,‚Äù Jain alleged on Saturday. Former Delhi deputy CM Manish Sisodia embraces AAP leader Satyendar Jain after the latter‚Äôs release from Tihar Jail. (Photo: Manish Sisodia/ X) Following Manish Sisodia‚Äôs arrest in February last year, both he and Jain had resigned from their respective berths on the Delhi Cabinet. Their individual portfolios were then distributed between Atishi and Saurabh Bharadwaj, who were then sworn in as ministers. ‚ÄúGiven how close the Assembly elections are, Jain‚Äôs reinduction into the Cabinet seems highly unlikely. On the other hand, given his health and his prolonged incarceration for almost two years, the party wants to give him some time to settle in, to think about and choose his future course of action,‚Äù an AAP insider said. Though he was unable to be part of the contingent of senior AAP leaders that went to receive Jain outside Tihar prison on Friday evening since he was in attendance at his daughter Harshita‚Äôs engagement, AAP national convener Arvind Kejriwal addressed a significant organisational meeting on Jain‚Äôs turf in Pitampura on Saturday evening. ‚ÄúArvind ji met him (Jain) very warmly at the (engagement) ceremony on Friday evening and addressed AAP MLAs, councillors and all organisational office bearers at one of the most important meetings related to the Delhi elections in Jain‚Äôs constituency on Saturday,‚Äù the insider added. A man of a few words who tended to stay behind the scenes, Jain is not particularly considered as an organisational man, but was seen as a no-nonsense and strong minister. His arrest, unrelated to the Delhi excise policy case, was followed by that of former Delhi Deputy CM Sisodia, AAP Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh and finally CM Kejriwal himself. After serving their respective stints behind bars, Singh, Sisodia and Kejriwal were released within months of each other; the only AAP leader currently in judicial custody is its Okhla MLA Amanatullah Khan, who was arrested by the ED in connection with a money laundering case related to alleged illegal recruitments in the Delhi Waqf Board. ‚ÄúHis (Jain‚Äôs) track record as a legislator may become an issue regarding his chances of being fielded for the Delhi Assembly elections,‚Äù a party source said. ‚ÄúHe has not spent a single rupee from his MLALAD funds‚Ä¶ Other AAP leaders like Arvind ji and Manish ji also went to jail but that did not deter them from working on and issuing directives regarding the development of their constituencies from behind bars,‚Äù the source said. ‚ÄúPerhaps he did not do so because he is not in favour of contesting from Shakur Basti again ‚Äì maybe he wants to be fielded from another constituency, maybe not at all,‚Äù the source claimed.","category":"politics"},{"publishedAt":"2024-10-22","title":"Mizoram power minister says convoy stopped, Assam Rifles says electricity cut¬†at¬†its¬†outposts","description":"In its statement, the Assam Rifles alleged that the minister‚Äôs secretary ‚Äúexited his vehicle, removed his jacket, and verbally abused the Assam Rifles personnel on duty‚Äù while other members of the convoy ‚Äúengaged in disruptive behaviour‚Äù.","urlToImage":"https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/10/Left-to-right-2024-10-20T075227.977.jpg?w=640","content":"Days after a confrontation between the Mizoram Power and Electricity Minister‚Äôs staff and Assam Rifles personnel at a security barricade on the outskirts of Aizawl, allegations are flying from both sides.

The Election Commission on Tuesday announced bypolls for seven seats in Rajasthan. While Chorasi was vacated after BAP founder Rajkumar Roat was elected to the Lok Sabha from Banswara as the INDIA bloc candidate, Salumber fell vacant after BJP MLA Amrit Lal Meena passed away in August. The BAP‚Äôs decision to announce its candidates in the two seats is likely to set up a contest with the Congress there. The Congress is yet to officially comment on the BAP‚Äôs announcement. It has not declared any candidates so far. The BAP named Anil Katara its Chorasi candidate and Jitesh Kumar Katara its Salumber nominee for the November 13 bypolls. In an announcement on the party‚Äôs official X handle, BAP state president Ramesh Maida said the two were chosen through its Janpratinidhi Selection Pranali (JPSP) or public representative selection process, in which party workers and locals of a particular constituency vote for their choice of candidate through a paper ballot. The Chorasi seat was won by Roat in the last two Assembly elections and is now considered a BAP stronghold, where its bypoll candidate Anil Katara is known locally for raising the tribal community‚Äôs issues. ‚ÄúWe had other names in the JPSP and one of them was hugely popular in an online survey by a newspaper. However, in the JPSP voting, Anil got more votes than the others which only shows his ground connect,‚Äù Maida told The Indian Express. In Salumber, the party had fielded Jitesh in the 2023 Assembly polls too, but he finished third with over 51,000 votes, behind the BJP and Congress candidates. Maida said Jitesh is an active member of the party and like Anil, is popular locally and frequently raises the tribal issues. ‚ÄúJitesh belongs to a very poor family, his father is a farmer and they still live in a mud house,‚Äù Maida said. As per the 2023 poll affidavit, Jitesh declared assets worth just Rs 22,642, which included Rs 5,000 in cash, silver worth Rs 7,000, and Rs 10,642 in his bank account, while his only debt is a Rs 5.5-lakh bank loan for a vehicle. ‚ÄúIn the BAP, a common man can also dream of contesting the MLA election and serving the nation, and we already have (Banswara MP) Rajkumar Roat. One doesn‚Äôt need any money or connection with the top leaders of the party to get a ticket,‚Äù Maida said. In Rajasthan, the last date for filing nominations for the bypolls is October 25.
