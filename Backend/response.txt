Hadia Moussa said the melody reminded her of the country’s Nuba Mountains, her family’s ancestral home. “Performances like this help people mentally affected by the war. It reminds us of the Sudanese folklore and our culture,” she said. Sudan has been engulfed by violence since April 2023, when war between the Sudanese military and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces broke out across the country. The conflict has turned the capital, Khartoum, into an urban battlefield and displaced 4.6 million people, according to the U.N. migration agency, including more than 419,000 people who fled to Egypt. <div overflow=\"\" role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\"></div> A band with 12 Sudanese members now lives with thousands of refugees in Egypt. The troupe, called “Camirata,” includes researchers, singers and poets who are determined to preserve the knowledge of traditional Sudanese folk music and dance to keep it from being lost in the ruinous war. Founded in 1997, the band rose to popularity in Khartoum before it began traveling to different states, enlisting diverse musicians, dancers and styles. They sing in 25 different Sudanese languages. Founder Dafallah el-Hag said the band’s members started relocating to Egypt in recently, as Sudan struggled through a difficult economic and political transition after a 2019 popular uprising unseated longtime ruler Omar al-Bashir. Others followed after the violence began. El-Hag arrived late last year. The band uses a variety of local musical instruments on stage. El-Hag says audiences are often surprised to see instruments such as the tanbour, a stringed instrument, being played with the nuggara drums, combined with tunes of the banimbo, a wooden xylophone. “This combination of musical instruments helped promote some sort of forgiveness and togetherness among the Sudanese people,” el-Hag said, adding that he is eager to revive a museum in Khartoum that housed historic instruments and was reportedly looted and damaged. Fatma Farid, 21, a singer and dancer from Kordofan, moved to Egypt in 2021. Her aunt was killed in 2023 when an explosive fell on their house in al-Obeid, the capital of North Kordofan. “The way I see art has changed a lot since the war began,” she said. “You think of what you present as an artist. You can deliver a message,” she said. Kawthar Osman, a native of Madani city who has been singing with the band since 1997, feels nostalgic when she sings about the Nile River, which forms in Sudan from two upper branches, the Blue and White Nile. “It reminds me of what makes Sudan the way it is,” she said, adding that the war only “pushed the band to sing more for peace.”Over 2 million Sudanese fled the country, mostly to neighboring Egypt and Chad, where the Global Hunger Index has reported a “serious” level of hunger in Chad. Over half a million forcibly displaced Sudanese have sought refuge in Chad, mostly women and children. Living conditions for those who stayed in Sudan have worsened as the war spread beyond Khartoum. Many made hard decisions early in the war either to flee across frontlines or risk being caught in the middle of fighting. In Darfur, the war turned particularly brutal and created famine conditions, with militias attacking entire villages and burning them to the ground. Armed robberies, lootings and the seizure of homes for bases were some of the challenges faced by Sudanese who stayed in the country’s urban areas. Others struggled to secure food and water, find sources for electricity and obtain medical treatment since hospitals have been raided by fighters or hit by airstrikes. Communications networks are often barely functional. The performers say they struggle to speak with family and friends still in the country, much less think about returning.“We don’t know if we’ll return to Sudan again or will see Sudan again or walk in the same streets,” Farid said. 📣 For more lifestyle news, click here to join our WhatsApp Channel and also follow us on Instagram","category":"lifestyle"},{"publishedAt":"2024-10-07","title":"Shehnaaz Gill says she was ‘possessive’ of boyfriend Sidharth Shukla; how can that affect a relationship?","description":"In a recent interview with Farah Khan, Shehnaaz candidly discussed her relationship with Siddharth, revealing her possessive nature.","urlToImage":"https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/10/sidharth-shehnaaz.jpg?w=640","content":"Shehnaaz Gill and Sidharth Shukla’s heartwarming bond, forged on Bigg Boss 13, captivated audiences and earned them a dedicated fanbase. While their connection was undeniable, the couple never publicly confirmed their relationship. Their story was tragically cut short in 2021 when Sidharth passed away due to a heart attack. In a recent interview with Farah Khan, Shehnaaz candidly discussed her relationship with Sidharth, revealing her possessive nature. She explained, “I don’t care about looks,” but acknowledged her jealousy, admitting, “I’m extremely possessive.” Reflecting on her feelings for Siddharth, she justified her behaviour, stating, “I was possessive because he was handsome. If someone is so good-looking, it’s natural to feel insecure and possessive.” Being with a possessive and jealous partner can have a significant negative impact on a relationship. Here are some of the potential consequences: <div overflow=\"\" role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\"></div> Sidharth Shukla passed away in September of 2021. Isolation: Possessive partners may try to isolate their partner from friends and family, leading to feelings of loneliness and isolation. “Your partner is a priority in your life, not your entire life. If someone is keeping you away from the other beautiful things, it is probably to have full control over your mind and your growth,” said Shahzeen Shivdasani, a relationship expert and author of the book ‘Love, Lust & Lemons’ in an interaction with indianexpress.com. Erosion of trust: Jealousy and possessiveness often stem from a lack of trust. This can lead to constant questioning, accusations, and a breakdown of trust between partners, Shivdasani added. Stifling of personal growth: Possessive partners may try to control their partner’s actions, limiting their freedom and personal growth. This can create feelings of resentment and suffocation, according to Shivdasani. Increased stress and anxiety: Living in a state of constant fear and uncertainty can lead to high levels of stress and anxiety for both partners. Emotional abuse: In extreme cases, possessiveness and jealousy can escalate into emotional abuse, including gaslighting, manipulation, and threats. If you are in a relationship with a possessive and jealous partner, it is important to seek help. There are resources available to support individuals in such situations, including therapy and support groups. It is essential to prioritise your own well-being and safety. 📣 For more lifestyle news, click here to join our WhatsApp Channel and also follow us on Instagram","category":"lifestyle"},{"publishedAt":"2024-10-07","title":"Coconuts are a zero-waste fruit; here’s how you can use every part of them","description":"An ever-versatile fruit, coconuts come in handy when it comes to whipping up tasty dishes or putting together skincare and haircare DIYs.","urlToImage":"https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/08/coconut-milk_600_freepik_20240823063003.jpg?w=640","content":"Most people like coconuts.

Indianexpress.com spoke to haircare experts to understand the key differences between hair styling products and how they stand to harm the health of your luscious mane. What are the key differences between hair gel, wax and mousse? Dr Kalyani Deshmukh, Consultant Dermatologist at Traya walked us through the fundamentals you need to know about a gel, wax and mousse before applying it on your hair. <div overflow=\"\" role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\"></div> Hair Gel: Water-based, provides a stiff hold with a shiny finish. It is generally used for structured, strong-hold styles like spikes or slicked-back looks. Hair Wax: Oil-based, offers a pliable hold with a matte finish. Hair wax is a go-to product when it comes to flexible, restyle-able, textured looks. Hair Mousse: Foam-based, adds volume with a light to medium hold and natural finish. If your hair lacks texture and falls flat, this is the product you should opt for to bring life back to the roots.

Besides cramps and unbearable pain, you also don’t get to indulge in your favourite foods and have to stick to tasteless, boring food for a while. To eat or not to eat is an age-old question plaguing those with persistent issues, and indianexpress.com finally got to the depth of it to try and understand what’s the best way forward when it comes to treating a stomach problem. “Skipping meals on a stomach upset can cause the stomach to produce more acid in anticipation of food, causing even more abdominal discomfort from bloating, belching, acidity and reflux,” said Vedika Premani, clinical dietician, Sir HN Reliance Foundation Hospital. <div overflow=\"\" role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\"></div> “Fasting or skipping meals, when your stomach is upset depends totally on the severity of the situation, and the cause of the discomfort,” shared Dt. Prerana Solanki, Dietitians, Consults on Practo. According to her, if the symptoms are mild, eating small frequent meals, easily digestible foods, and non-spicy and fatty foods is recommended. And if the symptoms are severe, one should consider short- term fasting for a few hours to let your stomach rest but focus on hydration. Solanki shared that when you have an upset stomach, fasting or skipping meals can sometimes provide relief by giving your digestive system a chance to rest. However, it is important to understand that our liver and kidneys naturally detoxify the body without the need for fasting. But she added that sometimes reducing food intake may help manage symptoms of an upset stomach and allow the stomach lining to heal if it’s irritated or inflamed. “Even if you fast, it’s crucial to stay hydrated. Drinking clear fluids like water, herbal teas, or clear soups helps prevent dehydration, especially if you’re experiencing vomiting or diarrhea,” she said. Pay attention to how your body reacts to different foods (Source: Freepik) What is the best way of going forward? Solanki said that short-term fasting and hydration is the key to overcome an upset stomach. “Also, once initial symptoms subside, one can reintroduce food gradually with the BRAT diet, which stands for banana, rice, applesauce and toast. Lastly pay attention to how your body reacts to different foods. If a food causes discomfort, avoid it until your stomach feels better,” she said.

Celebrity nutritionist Rujuta Diwekar has been sharing valuable wellness and diet tips on Instagram to help people prepare their bodies for the changing seasons. Recently, she posted a video highlighting foods that not only boost gut health but also ease the body into seasonal transitions. In the video, Diwekar recommended “three special foods” for Navratri such as raw banana wafers, dry dates, and badam and kaju puris, all of which are easy to incorporate into your diet. “The first thing I want to introduce you to are banana wafers. In India, we have so much diversity when it comes to raw banana wafers,” she said. <div overflow=\"\" role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\"></div> Then she spoke about the benefits of consuming dry dates. “For its fibre, iron, and good taste, you should start your day with dry dates, especially if you are craving sugar,” suggested Diwekar. For kids, she recommended, “I think a lot of us have forgotten our badam and kaju puris. Almond, cashew or pistachio can be used to make this with some spices and sugar.” View this post on Instagram A post shared by Rujuta Diwekar (@rujuta.diwekar) But how effective are these foods when incorporated into your diet during the Navratri period? Registered dietitian Anushree Sharma offers valuable insights on this topic. Specific gut health benefits of raw bananas Sharma says, “Raw bananas differ significantly from ripened bananas in terms of their nutritional composition. They contain a higher amount of starch, which gets converted into simpler carbohydrates as they ripen. This increased starch content leads to a slower digestion process, resulting in a lower glycemic index (GI) for raw bananas.” Consequently, she continues that they are beneficial for gut health, as the starch helps regulate bowel movements and prevents constipation. “Additionally, raw bananas are considered good probiotics. Although they share similarities with other fruits, the type of fibre and the GI can vary. To maintain optimal gut health, it’s essential to consume a diverse array of fruits, such as guava and pears, rather than relying solely on one type,” Sharma advises. She stresses, “When it comes to raw banana wafers, ensure that they are baked and not fried.” Role of dry dates in helping manage sugar cravings and improve digestion Sharma agrees with Diwekar that dry dates are another nutritious option worth considering. “They are naturally sweet and rich in fibre, making them an excellent choice for those craving something sweet. Their high fibre content not only provides a sense of fullness but also helps reduce overall cravings.” Moreover, dry dates are gut-friendly due to their fibre, vitamins, and minerals. They also contain polyphenols, which play a crucial role in maintaining healthy gut bacteria, thereby promoting better digestion and preventing gut inflammation. Raw bananas are considered good probiotics. (Source: Freepik) Can badam and kaju puris offer substantial nutritional benefits for adults and children? When it comes to healthy snack options, kaju puri (cashew puri) or badam puri (almond puri) can be good choices for kids, offering calories and nutritional benefits from the healthy fats and some protein found in nuts and milk. Sharma points out that the first thing to consider, as mentioned previously, is whether these badam and kaju puris “are fried or baked.” She says, “I will always recommend baked puris over fried ones.” For adults, especially those with health conditions like diabetes or heart issues, opting for baked versions instead of fried snacks is more beneficial, recommends Sharma. “Even children who are overweight should steer clear of fried options. Other healthy snacks to consider include makhana (fox nuts), makhana kheer (pudding) with less sugar, popcorn, dry fruit laddoos made with jaggery, and dry fruit panjiri (a sweet made from wheat and coconut).” DISCLAIMER: This article is based on information from the public domain and/or the experts we spoke to.

Born to actor Aroon and singer-actress Nirmala Devi, his early years were marked by a dramatic reversal of fortune. In a candid conversation with Simi Grewal in the past, he recounted how his father, after appearing in nearly 40 films, shifted to producing. However, a single failed film derailed their lives, forcing them to leave their grand home in Bandra for a modest house in Virar, far from the heart of Mumbai. Though both his mother and father passed away in the late 1990s — his mother in 1996 and his father in 1998 — they witnessed his meteoric rise to stardom. Govinda recently returned home from the hospital after being treated for an accidental gunshot wound and is now recovering.<div overflow=\"\" role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\"></div> View this post on Instagram A post shared by Govinda (@govinda_herono1) “He had made a film which didn’t work and he lost a lot of money. We had a bungalow at Carter Road, but after the film flopped, we had to move to Virar. That’s when the hard times began, and I was born. With failure, he was really shaken and he couldn’t take it and the entire family faced that difficulty,” Govinda shared. He recalled his own path, not initially envisioning a career in films. As a commerce graduate, Govinda sought jobs in various offices, even applying for a position at Taj Hotels, only to be turned down because he didn’t speak English. His primary drive was never fame, but the desire to lift his mother out of the difficult circumstances she faced. When Simi mentioned his earlier comment that it was his “anger at seeing the struggle of my mother that made me a star,” Govinda agreed, saying, “When you see your mother struggling to get through a bad patch in life, struggling very hard… She was coping with everything. I have seen her struggle through everything and I wanted to change it very fast.” When children see their parents struggle—whether it’s financially, emotionally, or health wise—it can create an environment of fear, instability, or heightened responsibility, explained Arouba Kabir, Emotional & Mental Health professional, Founder Enso wellness. View this post on Instagram A post shared by Govinda (@govinda_herono1) “Like Govinda, I have seen many clients who responded by developing a fierce determination to succeed, often driven by the need to rescue or uplift their families from hardship,” she said in an interaction. Children often internalise the struggles of their parents, suppressing their own needs and emotions to protect their parents, leading to emotional numbness or unhealthy coping mechanisms later in life. They might derive their sense of identity from their drive to succeed, financially, power and position wise but this can also create a deep-seated fear of failure or inadequacy. This constant need to prove oneself can lead to burnout, mental health issues, or a loss of personal identity outside of achievement. But, if the struggles are handled with resilience and open communication, Kabir said, children are more likely to develop emotional intelligence and healthier ways to manage stress as well. 📣 For more lifestyle news, click here to join our WhatsApp Channel and also follow us on Instagram","category":"lifestyle"},{"publishedAt":"2024-10-07","title":"You’re due for a colonoscopy, but what if you don’t want it?","description":"Colonoscopies are widely used, but there is another option available: faecal tests.","urlToImage":"https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/10/stomach-pain.jpg?w=640","content":"By Gina Kolata This year about 53,000 Americans are expected to die from colon or rectal cancer. Doctors say most people should start getting screened at age 45. Yet many who are eligible skip testing. When most people in this country think of colon cancer screening, they think of colonoscopies, which let doctors examine the colon but can be inconvenient. Yet there are other equally acceptable options for screening. <div overflow=\"\" role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\"></div> If more people knew about other kinds of colorectal cancer testing, some experts hope, perhaps some who put off colonoscopies would be screened and deaths from colon cancer could be avoided. Here’s what you need to know about colonoscopies and fecal tests, which to ask for, and why your doctor might be recommending one over the other. How do colonoscopies and fecal tests work? Colonoscopies are widely used, but there is another option available: fecal tests. Both types of test attempt to find cancers and large polyps — growths on the wall of the colon — that occasionally turn into cancers. Cancers that are found early often can be cured when doctors simply cut them out. Finding and removing polyps can also prevent cancers. Colonoscopies start with a patient’s taking strong laxatives to empty the colon. On the day of the test, the patient is sedated. Then, a doctor inserts a colonoscope — a flexible tube with a video camera at the end — into the rectum and colon and looks for polyps and cancers to remove. The doctor may also take samples for study in a lab. If no polyps or cancers are found, the average patient can wait 10 years before having another colonoscopy. Fecal tests can be done at home. Patients collect a stool sample and mail it to or drop it off at a testing lab. One option is the fecal immunochemical test, or FIT, which should be repeated annually. A lab analyzes the sample for traces of blood, which can indicate a polyp or cancer. Large polyps and colon cancers sporadically ooze small amounts of blood. If blood is detected, the patient must have a colonoscopy. Another more complex fecal test is Cologuard, repeated every three years. It looks for blood in stool and also for abnormal DNA from large polyps and colon cancers. Like the FIT test, Cologuard must be followed by a colonoscopy if blood or abnormal DNA are present. Which option actually works better? That depends on what is meant by “better.” One measure is how often a test finds large polyps. If a person who has a large polyp has a colonoscopy, the test will detect it 95% of the time. If that person has a Cologuard test, there is a 42% chance that it will be positive because of the polyp. If the person has a FIT test, there is about a 22% chance it will be positive. Another measure is how likely the test is to find cancers when they are present. Colonoscopies find 95%. A one-time Cologuard test will be positive 94% of the time if a cancer is present, and a FIT test will be positive 74% of the time. The ultimate goal, though, is preventing colon cancer deaths. For now, no one really knows which test performs better. One large clinical trial by the Department of Veterans Affairs is comparing the number of colon cancer deaths among 50,000 patients randomly assigned to have a colonoscopy or an annual FIT test and followed for 10 years. Results are expected in 2027 or 2028. While those studies are continuing, other studies have compared a screening test with no test. One study found that after 30 years, people who had fecal tests had a 33% lower death rate from colon cancer than people who were not screened. The death rate fell to 2%, from 3%. A 10-year European study of colonoscopy found a 30% reduction in the risk of getting colon cancer. It was 0.84% in a group that had colonoscopies and 1.22% in a group that was not screened. There was no difference in the risk of dying from colon cancer. Whether the reduction in the risk of getting colon cancer is worth a potential risk of injury during the surgery is “in the eye of the beholder,” said Dr. Michael Bretthauer, a gastroenterologist at the University of Oslo who led the study. The ultimate goal, though, is preventing colon cancer deaths. (Source: Freepik) Can I ask my doctor for a fecal test if I prefer it to a colonoscopy? Of course — if you are of average risk, meaning no family history of colon cancer and no genetic condition that predisposes to colon cancer. If you are at a higher risk, your doctor is likely to advise a colonoscopy. When patients of average risk ask Dr. David Lieberman, a gastroenterologist at Oregon Health and Science University, if they can skip the colonoscopy, he explains that a fecal test and a colonoscopy accomplish different things. Fecal tests are likely to find cancers when they are early enough to be cured. But he says those tests are not so good at finding precancerous polyps. While the hope is that, repeated over time, the fecal tests will find polyps, colonoscopies find both with a single test. Hearing that, he said, most patients decide they want colonoscopies. What do the tests cost? Many patients pay little or nothing because insurance, including Medicare, covers the tests. But testing does cost the health care system. Prices for the testing vary, but one estimate says a colonoscopy for people with private insurance costs the insurer about $3,442. A single Cologuard test costs about $763, and a single FIT test costs about $91. Why do doctors prefer colonoscopies? Many doctors think they are saving patients’ lives with colonoscopies. “The idea of finding and removing cancer precursor lesions became very attractive to physicians,” Lieberman said. But there is also a financial incentive for the procedure. “Colonoscopy is a massive revenue generator for hospital systems,” said Dr. Adewole Adamson, of the University of Texas at Austin, who studies cancer screening. Doctors profit too, said Dr. Samir Gupta, a gastroenterologist at the University of California, San Diego. “When we do the procedure, that’s part of our income,” he said. “We are all conflicted.” Many other countries with modern national health systems use FIT tests because they are cheap, and because they lack the capacity for wider use of colonoscopies. But there are places in the U.S. that don’t emphasize colonoscopies. Most VA centers mail FIT tests to eligible patients every year. So does Kaiser Permanente, one of the nation’s largest medical care providers. In the company’s lab in Northern California, for instance, testing is done “on an industrial scale,” said Dr. Theodore Levin, a Kaiser gastroenterologist, with 15,000 to 20,000 FIT tests processed each week. In describing some of Kaiser’s motivation for offering FIT, Levin added, “All the physicians are salaried, so they are not doing screening to support their practice.” Dr. Amitpal S. Johal, director of gastroenterology at Geisinger, a large health care system in Pennsylvania, says Cologuard is preferred because of its greater accuracy and because it only needs to be done every three years. The test is useful for the system’s large rural population for whom a center that does colonoscopies can be far away. “Some of these people can’t drive five hours” for the test, he said, while “Cologuard will mail the test to them, and UPS will pick it up.” When can I get a blood test instead of these options? The Food and Drug Administration recently approved a blood test called Shield by the company Guardant Health. The test looks for fragments of DNA shed from colon cancers and polyps. If it finds evidence of cancer or large polyps, you need a colonoscopy. The problem is that the test is not very accurate and does especially poorly at finding large polyps. Still, gastroenterologists say it is better than nothing. The blood test also is expensive at $1,495.

According to Sanchi Sharma, Counselling Psychologist at WellM, hugging triggers the release of oxytocin, often termed the “love hormone,” which significantly contributes to emotional well-being and stress reduction. Hugs are more than simple acts of affection—they’re vital for our well-being. According to Sanchi Sharma, Counselling Psychologist at WellM, hugging triggers the release of oxytocin, often referred to as the “love hormone,” which plays a significant role in emotional stability and stress reduction. Why Hugs Matter The popular notion that we need “four hugs for survival, eight for maintenance, and twelve for growth” highlights the importance of physical touch in our emotional health. While the specific numbers aren’t scientifically backed, the benefits of hugging are well-documented. Sharma points out that regular, affectionate touch has been shown to improve emotional well-being, reduce stress, and increase overall happiness—all thanks to oxytocin. <div overflow=\"\" role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\"></div> The Longer, the Better The duration of a hug can significantly enhance its impact. According to Sharma, hugs that last more than 20 seconds are the most effective in triggering oxytocin release and deepening emotional bonds. While brief hugs still offer benefits, longer embraces provide a greater sense of relaxation and connection. Hugging requires respect for individual comfort levels. (source: Freepik) Who Needs Hugs the Most? Some groups, particularly infants, children, and the elderly, benefit even more from physical touch. Hugs foster emotional and physical development in infants, provide children with a sense of love and security, and help ease feelings of loneliness and depression in the elderly. Hugs vs. Other Forms of Touch While a handshake or pat on the back can build social connections, Sharma emphasises that hugs are uniquely powerful. They offer longer, warmer contact, leading to a greater release of oxytocin and stronger emotional ties. In comparison, hugs are much more effective in conveying intimacy and support.

Rather than relying on supplements, health experts often recommend obtaining these vital nutrients through food. Clinical nutritionist Vedanti Dave explained that “vitamins are a group of substances that cannot be synthesised in the body and need to be supplied from external sources, such as food.” However, she added that “some vitamins, like K and B, are synthesised by intestinal bacteria.” Dave guided us through the health benefits of various vitamins and the food sources rich in them. <div overflow=\"\" role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\"></div> Vitamin A Vitamin A plays a crucial role in optimal vision, particularly in dim light, as well as in growth and development. A deficiency can make the body more susceptible to infections and can cause nutritional blindness, increased infections, and spontaneous pre-term delivery in women. Sources of Vitamin A include eggs, spirulina (blue-green algae), carrots, colocasia, coriander leaves, and spinach. Vitamin B Complex Vitamin B1 (Thiamine): Thiamine is essential for neuromotor coordination via its role in nerve conduction and energy production. Known as the “morale vitamin,” a deficiency can lead to mental depression, confusion, and reduced muscle strength. Pork, whole grains, and legumes are the richest sources. Vitamin B2 (Riboflavin): Riboflavin promotes antioxidant activity and cell repair. A deficiency can result in mouth sores, skin lesions, and slower muscle response. Dairy, eggs, and almonds are the best sources. Vitamin B3 (Niacin): Niacin helps prevent pellagra, which manifests as diarrhoea, dermatitis, and dementia. Groundnuts and meat are rich sources. Vitamin B5 (Pantothenic Acid): This vitamin is vital for hormone and cholesterol production. While deficiencies are rare, they can affect the nervous system. Liver, kidneys, egg yolks, and milk are good sources. Vitamin B6 (Pyridoxine): B6 enables red blood cell production and supports cognitive development. Deficiencies may lead to anaemia, sleep disturbances, and irritability. The richest sources include meat, fish, and poultry. Vitamin B7 (Biotin): Biotin supports healthy skin, hair, and nails. Deficiency symptoms include depression, hallucinations, and muscle pain. Egg yolks and soya beans are the best sources. Vitamin B9 (Folic Acid): Folic acid is crucial for DNA synthesis, particularly during pregnancy, as it helps prevent neural tube defects in the developing baby. A deficiency can lead to weight loss, weakness, and anorexia. Pulses, eggs, and leafy greens are rich in folate. Vitamin B12 (Cobalamin): B12 is important for neurological function and red blood cell formation. A deficiency can cause enlarged, immature blood cells. It is mainly found in animal products and fermented foods. Sources of Vitamin E include vegetable oils (rice bran oil), nuts and pulses. (Source: Getty Images/Thinkstock) Vitamin C Vitamin C functions as an antioxidant, aids in iron absorption, and helps prevent cataracts. A deficiency can cause bleeding gums, brittle bones, and delayed wound healing. Amla is one of the richest sources of Vitamin C. Vitamin D Essential for bone formation and maintenance, a lack of Vitamin D can cause softening of bones (osteomalacia) in both children and adults. Marine fish, butter, and egg yolks are rich sources of this vitamin. ALSO READ | Are you dealing with vitamin deficiencies?

View this post on Instagram <div overflow=\"\" role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\"></div> A post shared by How To Fail (@howtofailpod) How can this have a positive impact on their mental health? Psychologist Srishti Vatsa said that children internalise a lot of things that parents and caregivers tell them, which ends up shaping their internal conversations and perception of self. Speaking with kindness builds confidence in them. On the other hand, negative comments can bring in self doubt. Because body shaming by parents is so common in our society, children may develop body image issues at a very early age. Even the fears projected by parents become a part of kids’ internal dialogues. She mentioned that parents should also be observant of the other people in their children’s lives––close relatives and caregivers––and be mindful of the language being used to engage with the young ones. “Even labelling them as stupid can be ingrained deep into their psyche. Not only will the children actually start believing in it, they will also start embodying the same behaviour; it becomes a big factor contributing to their confidence,” Winslet said. It is important to focus their mindset on internal locus of control and process, rather than having their esteem linked to outcomes, which can lead to perfectionism (Source: Freepik) Counselling psychologist Priyamvada Tendulkar told indianexpress.com that complimenting young girls, especially on their efforts rather than their outcome, can hugely boost their self-esteem and make girls (or children) more internally driven rather than be dependent on external validation. “It is important to focus their mindset on internal locus of control and process, rather than having their esteem linked to outcomes, which can lead to perfectionism,” she said, adding that even paying attention to children’s feelings through the process can be a huge boost.

And how is he telling us this? Through a T-shirt, of course. <div overflow=\"\" role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\"></div> “I’ve kind of started working on this series of shirts with some of my favorite classical sayings on them,” Zuckerberg said in mid-September during a taping of the “Acquired” podcast at San Francisco’s Chase Center. He was wearing a boxy, black tee printed in plump white letters with the Greek phrase “pathei mathos.” Loose translation? “Learning through suffering.” It was, according to Zuckerberg, “a little family saying.” Another historical pearl was imparted through the T-shirt he wore at a Meta keynote presentation weeks later. This time, Greek was swapped for Latin. Kinda. His tee (again boxy, again black) read “aut Zuck, aut nihil,” an English-ified contortion of the Latin “aut Caesar, aut nihil” or, roughly, “either a Caesar or nothing.” It took more than a Zuck to create these wide-as-they-are-long tees. As he explained in the podcast, they were made in partnership with Mike Amiri, a Los Angeles-based fashion designer. Yes, between running Meta, making AI-enhanced spectacles, raising three children and all that MMA training, the 40-year-old Facebook founder has found time to tack yet another title onto his CV: clothing designer. (Before minting his own ancient-slogan shirts, Zuckerberg wore a tee splayed with the Latin “Carthago delenda est (Carthage must be destroyed),” to his 40th birthday in May. Similar shirts can be bought for $20 on Amazon.) That Zuckerberg even cares enough to dial up his own deliberately oversize tees shows that the CEO’s ongoing extreme fashion makeover Meta edition isn’t slowing anytime soon. In recent months, Zuckerberg has swapped his wet-newspaper gray hoodies for $250 Bode shirts with embroidered flowers. He’s grown out his hair, bulked up and piled on a gold chain. Now, like wannabe Virgil Ablohs before him, he’s making his own tees. But what’s with all the Greek and Latin? Through a representative, Zuckerberg declined an interview request for this article. But Zuckerberg does appear to fit the bill of an Ovid reading, “Gladiator” streaming, millennial man preoccupied with Roman might. He took Latin as far back as high school. He honeymooned in Rome and named one of his daughters August (get it? Like Augustus). He commissioned artist Daniel Arsham to make an imposing statue of his wife, Priscilla Chan, proclaiming on Instagram that he was “bringing back the Roman tradition of making sculptures of your wife.” “If you step back and look at the reasons why people — especially young men — seem to quote the classics, it’s a desire for power,” said Marcus Folch, associate professor of classics at Columbia University. “It articulates a desire for power.” It doesn’t take much imagination to see how Zuckerberg, guiding a millions-strong nation-state of app users, could fancy himself as a tech-age Tiberius. After all, he isn’t just quoting a Caesar in these shirts, he’s likening himself to him. Between running Meta, making artificial intelligence-enhanced spectacles, raising three children and all that MMA training, Facebook founder Zuckerberg has found time to tack yet another title onto his CV: clothing designer.(Jim Wilson/The New York Times) Zuckerberg may have entered the imperialist phase of his glow-up, but the meaning of the quotes might be getting lost between text and the T-shirt. John Noël Dillon, a senior lector in Yale University’s classics department, pointed out that “aut Caesar, aut nihil” is commonly ascribed to Italian cardinal Cesare Borgia, the inspiration for Niccolo Machiavelli’s book “The Prince.” In the end, enduring power eluded him, and he was stabbed to death at 31. According to scholars, “pathei mathos” is, at least, less directly egotistical. It’s a “very deep, kind of profound” quote stemming from Aeschylus’ mythological play on Agamemnon, said Folch. That text isn’t exactly obscure — if you’ve taken a Greek literature course in college, you likely read it — but it flashes a richer historical expertise than wearing a tee splayed with “veni vedi vici” (“I came, I saw, I conquered”).

For now, like an app in early development, the shirts aren’t available for public consumption, though Zuckerberg has hinted in Instagram comments that a “limited drop” might be incoming.

He revealed how the divorce was a result of their differing cultural backgrounds, and said “Co-existing with a person with an opinion is a full-time job“, hinting at his ex-wife. This made us wonder, why are opinionated people generally looked at in a negative light? <div overflow=\"\" role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\"></div> How does that impact their relationships? In conversation with counselling psychologist Srishti Vatsa, indianexpress.com learned that there are primarily two reasons why opinionated people get so much flak. “It is perfectly normal and healthy to put across one’s opinions in a relationship. Issues tend to arise when one partner insists on always being the right person. This can easily slip into stubbornness and an unwillingness to compromise, which tends to become damaging to the health of most relationships,” said Vatsa. Vatsa explained that Indian women, historically, have not been vocal about their wants and needs. “People in positions of seniority and authority often tend to consider disagreements synonymous with lack of respect. This stems from a feeling of insecurity and a constant need for validation and approval about the status quo,” she said. According to her, it is important to respect each other’s viewpoint and opinions in a relationship, even if they differ from one another. (Source: Freepik) Ashutosh Tiwari, psychologist and director of MindGlass Wellbeing Pvt Ltd, said that it is interesting to note that many people tend to prefer partners who are not opinionated, even today. “Despite differences in family and personal values, both men and women often seek someone who is willing to take steps forward together, rather than being too set in their own opinions.” According to research in the field of social psychology, having an opinionated partner can lead to conflicts when it comes to making compromises in daily life, said Tiwari. This is because individuals with rigid beliefs often struggle to be flexible and empathetic, making it difficult for them to adapt to changing circumstances. When it comes to couples belonging to different cultural backgrounds, there are moments when they strive to adapt. If a partner is strongly opinionated and refuses to adjust, Tiwari said that it can lead to misunderstandings and strain in the relationship. “Consequently, opinionated individuals are often viewed negatively or disliked by others. A continuous flow of disagreements can slowly erode trust and impede deep intimacy, ultimately causing harm to the relationship,” said Tiwari. 📣 For more lifestyle news, click here to join our WhatsApp Channel and also follow us on Instagram","category":"lifestyle"},{"publishedAt":"2024-10-07","title":"Katy Perry slips her phone and macaron into Balenciaga bag dress at Paris Fashion Week; see pictures inside","description":"Why was the Dark Horse singer seen sporting a QR code palm tattoo?","urlToImage":"https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/10/461579022_18489758374028089_8351738375389502256_n.jpg?w=640","content":"Katy Perry has always kept her fans on their toes with her bold and eclectic fashion choices, and her appearance at Paris Fashion Week was no different.

But how regularly should runners fork out hundreds of dollars on their next pair? Conventional wisdom tells us the average lifespan of a running shoe is around 500 to 800 kilometres. But where did this advice come from, and is it based on science? Some evidence comes from impact testing with machines designed to simulate the shoe repeatedly contacting the ground during running. Other evidence comes from monitoring runners who have used shoes in the real world for long periods. This research is often focused on shoe materials and structure. But we think more compelling markers for the runner are shoe comfort, performance benefit and injury risk. Rather than seeking a “one-size-fits-all” answer to how many kilometres your shoes should be limited to, it’s also better to consider individual signs based on your shoe type and its purpose.<div overflow=\"\" role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\"></div> The three signs to watch for Runners tend to replace their shoes for three main reasons: they believe their performance is being negatively impacted their shoes are leading to some bodily discomfort which may cause (or has already caused) an injury the shoes are no longer comfortable or “feel” as good as they used to. So what does the evidence say about these factors? Performance Some shoe material properties do contribute to enhanced running efficiency. Degrading these materials by racking up the kilometres may hinder peak performance on race day. This is most clearly seen in carbon fibre plate shoes used by modern elite runners to achieve rapid road race times. The design features thought to drive this are the combination of highly compliant and resilient midsole foam and a stiff embedded carbon fibre plate, which support energy storage and return. Runners will typically “save” these shoes for race day and replace them after fewer kilometres, compared to conventional running shoes. The available research does support the performance benefits of these shoes. However, it’s not known how long the benefits last relative to kilometres of wear. To our best knowledge, there’s only one study on running performance and shoe wear, but unfortunately it did not involve carbon fibre plate shoes. A University of Connecticut 2020 master’s thesis investigated eight college-level runners over 400 miles (643km) of Nike Pegasus shoe use. Also Read | Running faster or for longer: Find out which is better Large reductions in running economy were reported at 240km, and this was statistically significant at 320km. No reduction was observed at 160km. So, if you’re chasing personal best times, the evidence above suggests that for peak performance, shoes should be replaced somewhere between 160 and 240km (although this is not directly based on carbon fibre plate shoe research). It appears that minimising training kilometres for your favourite racing shoes – keeping them “fresh” – could contribute to peak performance on race day, compared to racing in a pair of old shoes. Injury or discomfort The link between shoe wear and injury is unclear, and based on minimal and often conflicting evidence. One study did find that runners who alternate their running shoes have a lower risk of injury than runners who run only in the same pair of shoes over a 22-week period. Runners who alternated shoes throughout the study period would have accumulated less wear in each shoe. This provides some support for the notion that accumulating too many kilometres in your shoes may increase risk of injury. Unfortunately, the exact age of running shoes was not reported in this study. However, based on the running characteristics reported, the single-shoe pair users completed an average of 320km in their shoes (after adjusting for a small fraction who had to replace shoes during the study). This was compared to the multi-shoe pair users who used an average of 3.6 pairs of shoes, ran more total kilometres, but accumulated an average of only 200km per shoe pair. Comfort Comfort and fit are the two most important factors to runners when selecting running shoes. Evidence linking improved shoe comfort to reduced injury rates or improved running economy is mixed, but reducing harms from poorly fitting and uncomfortable shoes is clearly a priority for runners. Most runners land on their heel. The repeated compression of the midsole causes the material to harden, possibly after as little as 160km, according to one study from 2017. However, there was virtually no change in the amount of cushioning runners perceived under their heel after 160km. Even after using the shoes for 640km, they felt little difference – about 3%. While at first this might seem like runners are not very good at judging when shoes lose their cushioning, it also tells us changes in perceived shoe cushioning are very gradual and may not be important for runners until they reach a certain threshold. This amount will differ from person to person, and from shoe to shoe, but research suggests it’s not until perceived cushioning reaches about a 10% chance that runners consider it meaningful. We must be careful when applying these findings to the latest running shoes which use newer materials. But you can use it as a rule of thumb – once you notice a drop in comfort, it’s time to get a new pair. When to choose new shoes Ultimately, there’s no one simple answer for when you should get new running shoes. You may also not keep close track of how many kilometres your favourite pair has racked up. Overall, we believe the most practical advice is to keep your racing shoes “fresh” (under 240km), alternate a couple of other pairs during regular training, and replace them when you detect a notable drop in comfort. 📣 For more lifestyle news, click here to join our WhatsApp Channel and also follow us on Instagram","category":"lifestyle"},{"publishedAt":"2024-10-07","title":"With the rise of ‘Sephora kids’, what should parents keep in mind when monitoring children’s skincare usage?","description":"Both experts agreed that maintaining a healthy diet and staying properly hydrated are essential for supporting healthy skin.","urlToImage":"https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/08/skincare-kids-2.jpg?w=640","content":"The latest generation of kids are smarter, more adaptable, and adept at understanding and being a part of social media trends.

But. he urged them to avoid potent ingredients like retinoids unless prescribed by a dermatologist. What is an ideal skincare routine for kids and teenagers? “The skincare routine for young children should be simple and gentle. A mild, fragrance-free cleanser can be used in the morning and night to keep the skin clean and clear. Following up with a simple, fragrance-free moisturizer is advisable if the skin is dry.

As he embarks on a recovery journey, indianexpress.com spoke to health experts across the board to figure out more about the non-surgical transcatheter method used to treat aortic aneurysm, and how safe it is compared to regular surgery. Dr Vimal Someshwar, head of interventional radiology at Kokilaben Dhirubhai Ambani Hospital, Mumbai, said that the procedure involves placing a stent graft across an aneurysm. This prevents blood from entering the dilated portion of the aneurysm while maintaining normal blood flow within the arterial system. <div overflow=\"\" role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\"></div> He said that this non-invasive method is much safer than traditional surgery, as it avoids the need to open the abdomen or chest. Instead, the procedure is performed by accessing the femoral arteries in the groin area, considerably reducing the risk of damage to nearby blood vessels, such as those in the kidneys or bowels. Post-procedure, patients are monitored for 24 hours in the ICU, after which they are shifted into a ward and kept there for a couple of days before discharge. They are called back for a follow-up after seven to 10 days to check if they are experiencing any trouble in the groin region or if the blood flow through the stent graph is alright. According to him, the aneurysm is a result of weakening of blood vessel walls. Ensuring cholesterol and blood pressure levels are regulated can go a long way in preventing recurrence. Keep a close watch on blood pressure (Source: Freepik) What does recovery look like? Dr Krishna Chaitanya, lead consultant for vascular and endovascular surgery at Aster CMI Hospital, Bangalore, said that recovery time varies depending on individual progress, but patients can usually return to normal activities within two to three weeks. Since the procedure is less invasive, most patients stay in the hospital for only two to three days.

Food Safety Commissioner Srinivas K urged bakeries across the state to be more vigilant about the ingredients they use, particularly warning against the use of harmful chemicals and artificial colouring agents. “Tests conducted on samples from various bakeries found excessive levels of artificial colours such as Allura Red, Sunset Yellow FCF, Ponceau 4R, Tartrazine, and Carmoisine in certain cake varieties,” Srinivas told indianexpress.com. This warning follows the department’s previous ban on artificial colours in dishes like gobi manchurian, kebabs, and pani puri sauces. <div overflow=\"\" role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\"></div> Dr Manisha Arora, director, internal medicine at CK Birla Hospital, Delhi, explained the potential health risks associated with these harmful substances. “Artificial colours, when consumed in quantities exceeding safety limits, can cause cellular damage, increase the risk of cancer, and lead to other health issues such as hormonal disruption and immune system impairment,” she said in an interview with indianexpress.com. While the occasional consumption of such cakes may pose minimal risk, Dr Arora said that regular intake could have significant long-term health consequences, especially for vulnerable groups like children, whose developing bodies are more sensitive to toxins. The FSSAI’s prompt warning to local bakeries is an effort to ensure stricter adherence to safety standards, safeguarding public health. Consumers should be mindful of where they source baked goods from, and should prefer products from trusted outlets. Staying informed about food safety regulations is also important. As the government takes measures to regulate the industry, awareness and caution are key to avoiding potential harm.

With five National Awards for Best Actress and the prestigious Padma Bhushan, Azmi has left an indelible mark on the film industry. She recently celebrated 50 years in cinema, with over 160 films spanning independent, neorealist, mainstream, and international projects. <div overflow=\"\" role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\"></div> To mark this milestone and pay tribute to her illustrious journey in the arts, Azmi returned to the stage after a significant hiatus, performing Girish Karnad’s Broken Images at the Delhi Theatre Festival. The play delved into identity and self-perception, examining how personal and societal influences shape one’s sense of self. Fame is a double-edged sword. It gives you visibility and a platform to influence, but it can also create a distorted sense of self Azmi said, reflecting on the same, in an exclusive interview with indianexpress.com.

Written by Javed Siddiqui in 1992, it toured worldwide. The story follows Amrita and Zulfikar’s love through 35 years of letters. The play ran for 20 years until Shaikh’s passing. @AzmiShabana pic.twitter.com/MDsvFaFLFt — Irfan (@irfaniyat) April 14, 2024 Shabana Azmi: Performing on stage provides an immediacy and a deep, live connection with the audience that films rarely do. The energy exchange is dynamic and unique with each performance. That unpredictability makes it exciting. Unlike film, where scenes can be reshot, theatre demands complete presence, emotional depth, and stamina. The intimacy of film lies in the camera, but the intimacy of theatre lies in the raw connection between the actor and the audience, which is irreplaceable. Q: What has been the most profound lesson you’ve learnt about fame and its impact on shaping one’s sense of identity? Shabana Azmi: Fame is a double-edged sword. It gives you visibility and a platform to influence, but it can also create a distorted sense of self. Early on, I learned the importance of separating self-worth from public recognition. Fame is fleeting, and if your identity is tied to it, you risk losing yourself. The most profound lesson I’ve learned is to stay true to my craft and focus on the work itself, not the adulation that comes with it. Whether in cinema or theatre, what matters is the authenticity of your expression and the impact of your work, not how the public perceives it. Q: How does performing live shape the way you create stories to inspire action, compared to film? How do you ensure the impact lasts beyond the performance? A still from Ankur. Shabana Azmi: Performing live creates a sense of urgency—there’s an energy that is palpable in the room, and it has the power to move people in real time. Theatre offers an opportunity to engage with the audience directly and emotionally, making it easier to inspire action. You feel the impact instantly, and there’s a collective experience that bonds the audience and the performer. To ensure the impact lasts beyond the performance, I focus on stories that resonate with people on a personal level, stories that make them think, question, and reflect on their own lives. Theatre, unlike film, allows for deeper engagement because the audience can’t passively consume it—they are participants in the experience. Must Read | Rajat Kapoor on directing plays and films: 'They are vastly different worlds' Q: How do you keep theatre authentic while meeting modern audience expectations in today’s digital age? Shabana Azmi: The challenge is to remain true to the essence of theatre, which is rooted in human connection. I believe authenticity in theatre comes from the rawness of live performance, and the vulnerability of being on stage with nothing to hide behind. That said, modern audiences are often conditioned by technology, so incorporating elements like multimedia can enhance the storytelling without compromising its integrity. Broken Images encapsulates both theatre and technology through its live performance and interactions with a digital image. The key is to use these tools as enhancements, not distractions. At its core, theatre is about truth and emotion, and as long as we stay focused on that, it remains authentic, even in today’s digital age. 📣 For more lifestyle news, click here to join our WhatsApp Channel and also follow us on Instagram","category":"lifestyle"},{"publishedAt":"2024-10-07","title":"Hawk-eyed fans spot Katrina Kaif wearing fitness patch on the arm as she steps out for Navratri celebrations; we find out what it is","description":"Before using such patches, it is advisable to consult doctors and healthcare providers, particularly if the user does not have diabetes.","urlToImage":"https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/10/katrina_cgm_1600-express-varinder.jpg?w=640","content":"Katrina Kaif made heads turn with her appearance at a Navratri celebration in Kerala’s Kochi in a Tarun Tahiliani sari.

Here’s what a dietitian has to say","description":"A person suffering from cholelithiasis should avoid processed and spicy food, and include physical activity and certain yoga asanas in their daily routine.","urlToImage":"https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/08/stomach-upset-1.jpg?w=640","content":"Gallbladder stones, also known as cholelithiasis, can be a painful impediment in our daily routine. In most cases, an expensive surgery is the solution. However, holistic health coaches and Ayurveda experts believe these stones can be removed with the power of diet and nutrition. Is there any scientific backing to this? Indianexpress.com spoke to a clinical expert on nutrition to understand this. According to clinical dietitian Dt. Ridhima Gupta, it is possible to get rid of gallstones through diet and correct nutrition, provided the case is not severe and complicated, and the patient is not having underlying metabolic disorders. She said that with consistent dietary and lifestyle modifications, one can at least postpone the need of surgery to a great extent. <div overflow=\"\" role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\"></div> What kind of foods must one have to achieve this? “Although a comprehensive approach including dietary interventions, physical activity, sleep and stress management is the key resolution to the concern, there are certain foods that aid better in the case of cholelithiasis,” said Gupta. Apple cider vinegar (ACV) is an important part of body cleanse diets. Hypochlorhydria is one prime cause of cholelithiasis and ACV helps in managing the acid levels thus helping indirectly in resolving the issue. Apple juice is believed to help via softening the gallstones and thus, easy dumping out from the body. A glass of apple juice for four to five days is the recommended dosage. Artichoke is another superfood which helps to lower the LDL levels, decreasing the formation and stimulating the dissolution of cholesterol-type gallstones. Supplement consumption for 12 weeks is generally prescribed. According to Gupta, the Gall Bladder Cleanse or Gall Bladder Flush is another approach which shows great results. “The patient in this diet is primarily asked to consume apple juice, vegetable juice throughout the day, and olive oil with lime juice during the evenings. It is a restrictive and strict approach and should be reconsidered specifically for people with diabetes and other conditions,” she said. According to Gupta, castor oil packs are another folk remedy. “Warm clothes are soaked in castor oil, which you then place on your abdomen. The packs are supposed to relieve pain and help treat your gallstones,” she said. According to Gupta, the Gall Bladder Cleanse or Gall Bladder Flush is another approach which shows great results. (Source: Freepik) Can pineapples help in removing gall stones? “The truth is, pineapple actually helps in reducing inflammation in the organs due to the presence of bioactive compound Bromelain and high ascorbic acid levels. This reduces irritation and pain. Reduction in inflammation can actually help a person to postpone the need for surgical intervention,” Gupta said. However, Gupta warned patients suffering from diabetes and high potassium levels to be careful before trying it out. Gupta shared that people with cholelithiasis should avoid processed and spicy foods, and stressed on the importance of including physical activity and certain yoga asanas in their daily routine. When should you go surgery and not rely on nutrition for the removal of stones? Gupta encouraged trying to treat the issue using natural and dietary means before considering surgery.

At the time, Perino was one of the few people to take such a public approach in seeking a relationship. He recently reposted the flyers, though now it seems that he’s one of many looking for love in this way. <div overflow=\"\" role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\"></div> Noticing a rise in analog dating techniques, Danielle Dietzek and Julie Griggs, the founders of Fourplay, an app where single friends team up, match with other pairs of single friends and go on double dates, recently started a marketing campaign with flyers that resemble personal ads. The flyers were strategically placed throughout New York City, in Greenpoint, Murray Hill, Williamsburg, the East Village, West Village, Lower East Side, Upper East Side and in Hoboken, New Jersey. They included trackable QR codes that linked back to the app store where you could download Fourplay. In the past week, the flyers have been scanned nearly 450 times, indicating a shift in how singles are looking to connect. But it’s not just flyers. In Philadelphia, David Cline, a 28-year-old data manager, made a “Dave is single” billboard and corresponding Instagram account as a new kind of dating profile. Initially intending it to be a goofy experiment, Cline has found the influx of responses, with nearly 500 people reaching out, to be a welcome change from the dearth of replies on dating apps. This summer, one of them came from Danya Trommer, a comedian who works in advertising. Trommer, formerly of Boston, saw Cline’s billboard in a Facebook post just a few weeks before moving to Philadelphia and was intrigued. “I went on Dave’s profile and his latest post was about Mega Man Battle Network, which is such a niche video game,” she said. She recalled thinking, “I’ve got to talk to this guy.” Trommer has never been a dating app fan, preferring to meet people more organically. “Apps really just gamify the entire process and make it pretty weird if you’re looking for actual connection,” she said. While not in the market for a relationship, she figured there was nothing to lose by reaching out to a “random guy on a billboard.” She and Cline talked for a month before going on a date, after which they decided to remain friends. These public encounters seem to illustrate something larger happening in dating culture. Enter the “pitch me” movement, which includes the rise of dating business cards, Google Forms and various pitch-dating events. With live shows first in San Francisco and now in New York, Tinder Disrupt features people giving PowerPoint presentations about a single friend. Participants entertain the audience with lighthearted, funny performances. Their presentations often use bullet points, charts, graphics, pictures and effects that highlight the friend’s best assets. Rose Oser, the host and creator of Tinder Disrupt, which is not officially affiliated with Tinder, said the shows — totaling 50 since 2016 — have been highly successful. Each show has around 100 attendees, with an estimated 5,000 audience members. Oser estimates that around 95% of participants get phone numbers from audience members or exchange Instagram handles. While many of those pitched onstage have received date requests, some have even started long-term relationships, she said. There have even been two marriages and one Tinder Disrupt baby, Oser said. In New York and San Francisco, she has recently started a new show around poly dating called Poly Poly Oxen Free, in which someone’s partner pitches them to the crowd. A year ago at a New York Tinder Disrupt, Ryan Alt, a 39-year-old director of operations in the software industry, got several phone numbers after the show and went on a few dates with someone, though they didn’t lead to anything serious. But, he said, “I now have a ready-made elevator pitch for new prospective partners.” And participating in the show made him feel like part of a fun community. “I’ve tried the dating apps and I just can’t seem to get over the online shopping vibe it gives me,” he said, “and so I thought going to an event like this would encourage a more organic meeting of potential romantic partners.” Haley Godbold, a 28-year-old high school teacher in the Bay Area, had no expectations of finding a meaningful connection when she participated in Tinder Disrupt in San Francisco in 2019. After the show, she gave out her number to about 10 people and received a “million” compliments. “It was funny that everyone in the audience knew quite a bit about me, but I knew nothing about them,” she said, adding that it was a great opportunity for conversation. Godbold did find genuine love through the event. “We were together for four years and it was one of the healthiest relationships of my life,” she said. Though the couple are not together anymore, Godbold said, she always enjoys telling the story of how they met. Although not all participants make meaningful connections, many say the show has helped them gain confidence and reignited their desire to put themselves out there. Other similar events have recently popped up in Florida and Mexico. The pitch-me approach is becoming increasingly common, in many cases because of daters’ sheer frustration. Jaime Bernstein, the vice president for client experience at the matchmaker company Three Day Rule, recalled a client who made business cards and carried them everywhere. One side of the card said, “Romantic, witty, world traveler seeking active family/friend-oriented, adventure partner,” and the other side had her contact info with an email address created just for this purpose. (The cards haven’t yet resulted in dates, she said.) Handing out “in the business of dating cards” sparks the fun in dating, said Kara Laricks, a senior matchmaker at Three Day Rule. It also shows that you’ve put some thought into your search, which is better than sending another “hey” message on a dating app, she said. Clips of young people handing out “dating cards” or “call me cards” have been spreading over social media. On TikTok, users have also begun sharing “date me applications,” created using Google forms. Zoe Butler, a 26-year-old musician, said she received around 500 responses after sharing her application form online. Cline, who opted for the billboard, understands why people are willing to try new things when it comes to dating. “It’s frustrating and depressing to see people in your life seemingly find a partner easily,” he said. “When you try really hard to put yourself out there and meet people, only to find failure, it can make it feel like you’re unlovable.” Most people, Cline added, “want to know that they’re normal, good looking, and that dating apps are really just a bad place right now.” Blaine Anderson, a dating coach in Austin, Texas, still recommends dating apps to her clients. But she has also seen rising interest in dating running clubs, matchmaking and singles events, as people expand beyond the apps. These activities may help people feel a little less awkward about approaching someone, she said. Why the shift? “While the apps were enhancing connection in the way that people were meeting people that they wouldn’t have otherwise met, over time they have decreased connection and they’ve continued to add to loneliness and isolation,” said Rachel Wright, a relationship therapist in New York. She added that dating apps run on algorithms that try to keep you on them. But shifting to the pitch-dating mode typically requires a lot more courage than just signing up for an app, Bernstein said. “I think daters are at a point now where they feel if they really want to prioritize dating, they have to get brave and creative,” she said. Anderson agreed. “Twenty years ago,” she said, “you probably would have been mocked for making a ‘pitch me’ PowerPoint, assuming you could even find anyone to watch it.” 📣 For more lifestyle news, click here to join our WhatsApp Channel and also follow us on Instagram","category":"lifestyle"},{"publishedAt":"2024-10-07","title":"This plant-based gel approved by the FDA is revolutionising trauma care with rapid bleeding control; find out what it is","description":"This new hemostatic agent is designed to address severe bleeding in emergency and trauma situations.","urlToImage":"https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/10/bleeding-1.jpg?w=640","content":"The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has recently approved a plant-based gel designed to rapidly stop bleeding and enhance the body’s natural clotting process. “The ability to rapidly stop bleeding at the point of care and halt a life-threatening haemorrhage can be the difference between life and death for people with traumatic wounds,” said Joe Landolina, CEO and co-founder of Cresilon and inventor of the technology. This innovative solution could have significant implications for medical emergencies, offering vital support to first responders, military personnel, and those in remote areas with limited access to immediate care. <div overflow=\"\" role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\"></div> Developed as a tool to stabilise wounds quickly, Cresilon’s Traumagel’s approval opens new possibilities for trauma care. But how exactly does this gel work, and what makes it different from traditional hemostatic agents? To understand its full potential, we turned to experts who can provide insights into its effectiveness and applications. The FDA has approved Traumagel. a plant-based gel that quickly stops bleeding and helps the body’s natural clotting process. This could be vital for first responders, military personnel, and remote care. Thoughts?#FDAApproval #TraumaCare pic.twitter.com/apYuQADkSR — Zain Khalpey, MD, PhD, FACS (@ZainKhalpey) October 2, 2024 Dr CM Nagesh, MBBS, MD, DM Cardiology (AIIMS, New Delhi), general secretary of the Indian College of Cardiology (ICC), tells indianexpress.com, “The gel is a new hemostatic agent approved by the FDA, designed to address severe bleeding in emergency and trauma situations. It comprises biocompatible polymers and bioactive components that aid in rapid blood clotting by encouraging platelet aggregation and fibrin formation. This forms a stable clot, which helps stop blood loss. The gel-based formulation is particularly advantageous because it adheres to wet surfaces — a critical feature in heavily bleeding wounds.” However, he adds that while it is designed to provide rapid clot formation, “the real-world efficacy still depends on several factors,” such as the severity of the injury and the wound environment. Its ability to act as a physical barrier also minimises contamination, but this does not guarantee complete sterility. How does this gel compare to other hemostatic agents? Compared to established hemostatic agents, which use kaolin or chitosan to promote clotting, this product introduces a gel-based system. Dr Nagesh adds, “Its ability to adhere to wet surfaces gives it an edge in specific situations, especially those involving actively bleeding wounds. In contrast, traditional powdered or gauze-based hemostatics may not be as effective on wet wounds.” That said, he says, each hemostatic agent has advantages and limitations depending on the situation. Can the gel be used effectively on different wounds, including severe injuries? It is designed to be versatile and can be used on various wounds, from minor cuts to severe traumatic injuries, says Dr Nagesh. “It has shown promise in early trials for its rapid action, stopping blood flow within minutes of application. Its ability to cover and adhere to irregular wound surfaces provides a practical advantage in situations involving deep lacerations or penetrating injuries.” Dr Nagesh stresses, “However, the gel’s performance may be influenced by factors such as the size and depth of the wound, as well as environmental conditions like temperature and moisture levels. While it is reported to work quickly in controlled conditions, further studies are needed to fully assess how it performs under different environmental stressors or when applied by non-medical personnel.” While it offers rapid clotting and wound coverage, especially on wet surfaces, its performance in extreme conditions and its risks of allergic reactions and infection must be carefully considered (Source: Freepik) Potential limitations or risks associated Dr Jagadish Hiremath, public health intellectual, states that while the gel introduces a promising option for managing severe bleeding, “it is not without limitations.” Its effectiveness, compared to existing hemostatic agents, still requires further study in diverse real-world environments. “While it offers rapid clotting and wound coverage, especially on wet surfaces, its performance in extreme conditions and its risks of allergic reactions and infection must be carefully considered,” he warns. Dr Nagesh remarks, “In extreme temperatures or wet conditions, the gel’s effectiveness could be compromised. Cold environments might slow the adhesive properties, while excessive moisture could interfere with clotting efficiency.” Furthermore, despite forming a protective barrier, improper wound cleaning before application may trap bacteria beneath the gel, increasing the risk of infection. “Although the gel is designed to be biocompatible, individuals with known sensitivity to certain polymers may experience localised reactions such as swelling or inflammation,” Dr Nagesh mentions.

Merchant, a director at Encore Healthcare, a family-owned pharmaceutical company, recently shared what it was like growing up. Owing to the environment in which she spent her formative years, Merchant developed a deep understanding of the business from a young age. “These were dinner table discussions,” she recalled in a panel discussion organised by Entrepreneur India last month. Merchant cited a childhood experience in Oman as a pivotal moment in shaping her priorities. “We were visiting my grandfather in Oman. He was unwell. That’s where he lived. My parents flew back for a USFDA audit because of how important that was,” she said.<div overflow=\"\" role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\"></div> View this post on Instagram A post shared by Meera Sakhrani (@meerasakhrani) Merchant emphasised the significance of relationships and family values in her career. “I come from a family where relationships are paramount,” she said. “Growing up, I was instilled with the belief that being part of the business community and contributing to the family and country were of utmost importance.” Growing up in a business-focused family can significantly shape a child’s mental health and priorities as an adult, offering both unique advantages and potential challenges, explained Priyamvada Tendulkar, a counselling psychologist. Pros of growing up in a business-focused family One significant advantage of growing up in a business family is the exposure to an abundance mindset. According to Tendulkar, children in such families grow up with a strong sense of economic boldness and are often detached from the traditional “middle-class, salaried” mindset. This mindset teaches them to think beyond the monthly paycheck and embrace risks, fostering a focus on annual income and long-term profitability rather than the perceived security of fixed, stable incomes. This environment encourages children to be bold in their economic choices and presentations. Lessons in risk-taking and resource management from a young age can lay the groundwork for entrepreneurial thinking, something most people only encounter later in life, she explained. The psychological resilience built through early exposure to business strategies often makes individuals more comfortable with uncertainty and fluctuations in the market, providing a unique edge in adulthood. Cons and psychological challenges However, this environment comes with its own set of psychological challenges. Tendulkar points out individuality is often discouraged in business families where cohesion is crucial. Children may grow up in traditional and hierarchical structures where the “family boss” holds most of the decision-making power. This can limit personal freedom and creativity, making children feel suppressed or unable to express their true selves. Such structures can lead to repressed anger, depression, or rebellious behaviors in adult life, as many feel restricted by the weight of familial expectations. Moreover, the pressure to perform and exceed the success of previous generations can be immense. As Tendulkar explains, “Making it that big is rare, and to do so two generations in a row is even rarer.” Children in business families often face the emotional strain of being compared to their highly successful parents, leading to feelings of inadequacy or failure. This unique form of pressure can foster a particular existential crisis, where material security exists, but existential freedom is absent, resulting in existential depression. 📣 For more lifestyle news, click here to join our WhatsApp Channel and also follow us on Instagram","category":"lifestyle"},{"publishedAt":"2024-10-07","title":"Tragedy strikes IAF event in Chennai – 5 dead, scores hospitalised as 12 lakh turn up","description":"The October 6 air show, held to commemorate the IAF’s 92nd anniversary, was the first such event in Chennai in over two decades. But both organisers and authorities appeared woefully underprepared for the turnout.","urlToImage":"https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/10/marina-beach.jpg?w=640","content":"A day meant to mark a moment of national pride for the Indian Air Force (IAF) turned into a nightmare at Chennai’s Marina Beach, when a crowd of more than 12 lakh people surged toward exits, leaving five dead and many hospitalised. The October 6 air show, held to commemorate the IAF’s 92nd anniversary, was the first such event in Chennai in over two decades. What was intended to be a spectacle of military aviation ended in chaos as the sheer size of the crowd overwhelmed both organisers and local authorities. A senior police officer said that by late Sunday evening, five deaths had been confirmed and 40 people were in hospitals. “Over 150 people have received first aid in various parts of the city due to the dehydration and stress they faced. One death was reported on the beach, another near Napier Bridge. Other victims died on their way back home at different places. It was not a stampede situation at one particular place,” the officer said. The event, widely publicised by both the IAF, attracted more than 12 lakh spectators to the sprawling Marina Beach. By 7 am, people had begun assembling at the two-kilometre stretch of coastline to secure vantage points for the 11.30 am to 1 pm air show. Families, children, and the elderly arrived by trains, metros, buses, and private vehicles – thousands of four-wheelers and two-wheelers – eager to witness the show, which had even earned a spot in the Limca Book of Records for its unprecedented attendance. However, when the event ended at 1 pm, the entire crowd attempted to leave the area at once. Traffic authorities were unprepared to manage the mass exodus, and soon, congestion built up around Marina Beach, paralysing movement for more than an hour. Eyewitnesses reported panic among attendees as they found themselves trapped. “It was suffocating, we couldn’t move at all,” said Abhasree, who attended the show till the end. Near Napier Bridge, Karthikeyan, 34, who came with family, suffered a fatal heart attack. Many who attended the show had experiences of dehydration and fainting, as temperatures soared to 36 degrees Celsius, with no provision for water or medical assistance readily available, attendees said. Among the deceased were Srinivasan, 48, who died near Santhome after collapsing in a parking area; John Babu, 56, a former staff member of Omandurar hospital, who died while trying to retrieve his scooter from the hospital’s parking lot; and Dinesh, who was found unconscious near the shoreline. Each of these deaths occurred not in the throes of a stampede, but in the aftermath of mismanagement that led to people being stranded in overcrowded conditions for far too long. While the state government had anticipated a large crowd – initial estimates predicted around 10 lakh people – the actual turnout exceeded even those expectations. The administration, which had made arrangements for crowd control, appeared woefully underprepared for the scale of the event. The lack of adequate transportation added to the confusion, as Chennai Metro Rail Limited services proved insufficient to ferry the massive number of attendees. Crowds swelled not only at the beach but at train stations like Velachery and Government Estate, with photos and videos of the unprecedented crowd at these local stations going viral on social media. The Chepauk Stadium, a venue next to the beach that regularly handles up to 40,000 people during cricket matches, is nearby. But the beach received more than 12 lakh spectators, with nowhere near the same level of planning or control. As the crowd funneled through limited exits and narrow streets, desperate attendees sought refuge by cutting through nearby areas, including the Madras University campus on Kamaraj Salai. However, even these makeshift routes were not enough to stave off the chaos that ensued.","category":"india"},{"publishedAt":"2024-10-07","title":"CPM-backed MLA under fire for saying ‘most caught for gold smuggling in Kozhikode airport are Muslims’","description":"K T Jaleel’s comments have drawn a sharp reaction from the IUML, which plays a leading role in Malappuram politics.","urlToImage":"https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/10/kt-jaleel.jpg?w=640","content":"At a time when Kerala’s ruling CPI(M) is facing criticism over Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan’s remarks linking Malappuram district with gold smuggling, Left-backed legislator K T Jaleel has come under fire for saying “most people being caught in connection with gold smuggling at Kozhikode airport are Muslims”. The Left alliance has been in damage control mode since CM Vijayan said in a press conference last month that “figures show large amounts of hawala and gold are coming through Kozhikode airport (situated in Malappuram district). Malappuram accounts for a major share of gold and hawala, which police have seized in the last three years”. Vijayan was responding to party-backed independent legislator P V Anvar’s allegation that police in Malappuram are implicating innocent people in crimes. Jaleel, who is known to be close to Vijayan, told the CPI(M)-run daily Deshabhimani and Manorama News TV channel on Sunday that religious leaders should tell people not to engage in gold smuggling. “Why are religious leaders, in their sermons, not telling people to keep away from gold smuggling and hawala dealings. Why don’t they say that these activities are against religion and the faithful should not indulge in such activities. Let Indian Union Muslim League (IUML, a partner in the opposition UDF alliance) state president Panakkad Sadiq Ali Shihab Thangal, who is the qazi of hundreds of mosques in Kerala, issue a fatwa saying that gold smuggling is anti-national. Let them say the faithful should keep away from gold smuggling and should not handle hawala money,” he said. In a Facebook post on Sunday, Jaleel further said, “Most people being caught in connection with gold smuggling at Kozhikode airport are Muslims. Without addressing this scenario, what reforms and progress do those who love Malappuram intend to bring in the community. Most Muslims who are involved in gold smuggling and hawala think that their act is not against their religion. When I say that qazis should come forward to enlighten such people, how does that become Islamophobia?” Jaleel said. Malappuram is a Muslim-majority district. Jaleel’s comments have drawn a sharp reaction from the IUML, which plays a leading role in Malappuram politics. IUML general secretary P M A Salam said Jaleel is depicting an entire community as criminals. “It is despicable and dangerous. He has created an impression that the community is engaged in smuggling. Even BJP leaders have not raised such an allegation. Jaleel wanted to take Vijayan’s statements on Malappuram to another realm. He should tender an apology to the community,” said Salam. Jaleel, who has been a CPI(M)-backed legislator since 2006, had come under the shadow of a Customs probe in 2020 in the wake of a case related to alleged smuggling of goods through diplomatic cargo to the UAE consulate in Thiruvananthapuram. Jaleel was minister for Higher Education at the time, and was questioned by Customs after being named a “person of interest” in cases of illegal import of dates and religious texts through diplomatic cargo. The NIA had also questioned him in connection with the case.","category":"india"},{"publishedAt":"2024-10-07","title":"‘First Announce, Second Think’: Congress slams govt after it ‘approves’ railway services demerger","description":"On October 5, 2024, the government rolled back its decision and will now continue to recruit through two separate examinations, one for Civil Services and one for Engineering Services, he claimed.","urlToImage":"https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/10/Jairam-Ramesh-.jpg?w=640","content":"The Congress on Sunday slammed the Centre after it reportedly rolled back the merger of eight railway services to create one, and said the “First Announce, Second Think” mentality of Prime Minister Narendra Modi continues to spell danger to the country’s institutions. There was no official word from the government on the reported move. Congress general secretary (In-charge, Communications) Jairam Ramesh cited a media report which claimed that almost five years after merging the eight services into a single civil service, the Ministry of Railways has now decided that recruitment will be made through two different examinations — the Civil Services Examination (CSE) for non-technical posts and Engineering Services Examination (ESE) for technical. In a post on X, Ramesh said, “This was not a case of Railway Reforms but actually a case of Railway Deforms.” “Five years ago, the non-biological PM’s Government merged eight railway services into the Indian Railway Management Service (IRMS) and discontinued recruitment through the Engineering Services Examination,” he said. On October 5, 2024, the government rolled back its decision and will now continue to recruit through two separate examinations, one for Civil Services and one for Engineering Services, he claimed. “The rollback was motivated by concern that too many officers coming in were generalists and lacked the technical and engineering skills required,” Ramesh said. “This FAST mentality of the non-biological PM – First Announce, Second Think – continues to spell danger to our institutions especially,” the Congress leader said. The railways are fundamentally an engineering system, and the deliberate attempt to forget this fact in the rush to standardise all recruitment was foolhardy, Ramesh said.","category":"india"},{"publishedAt":"2024-10-07","title":"Tripura Congress alleges quid pro quo in land allotment to private hospital without tender","description":"Tripura Health Minister Sushanta Chowdhury defends the decision and says the process has been underway for the past one year, but land has not been handed over yet.","urlToImage":"https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/10/Tripura-Congress.jpg?w=640","content":"Tripura’s Opposition Congress trained its guns at the BJP-led government on Sunday and demanded a clarification from Chief Minister Manik Saha on a plan to allot government land to a private hospital without a tender process. “If someone assumes they can do whatever they fancy, ignore the council of ministers, or believe they are above the Constitution and law after taking the oath as chief minister, it is completely unacceptable,” Congress MLA Sudip Roy Barman said. Barman cited a recent kidney transplant operation conducted at Agartala Government Medical College with the assistance of doctors from outside the state. He expressed concern over why external doctors were brought in for a single surgery, claiming to have uncovered troubling information. “I have now come to know the truth. There is an office of the Agricultural and Rural Development Department at Bodhjungnagar, where the department was forced to provide a no-objection certificate (NOC) for a 28-acre plot of land to be handed over to the district magistrate. The real reason for this is to allot the land to the private hospital that provided doctors for the surgery,” he alleged. Barman referred to a standing government decision that allows land to be leased to private parties for 33 years, stating that no government rule permits the allotment of land to private entities without a tender process. Reflecting on his tenure as the health minister in BJP leader Biplab Deb’s cabinet, Barman said he had initiated a tender for opening a multi-speciality hospital and never engaged in handpicking development partners. He said no decision had been made in the council of ministers to allot 28 acres of land to a private hospital, suggesting that the chief minister had bypassed the cabinet. ‘Chanda lo, Chanda do’ He alleged the government had adopted quid pro quo, hinting at some sort of illegal trade-off with the private hospital. “I want to ask the cabinet ministers if they have any sense of self-respect! Do they have any sense of respect and dignity? Government land is given to a private party without consulting them; is it not illegal? In reality, the chief minister is directed by bhai and bondhu. It has been reduced to a government of bhai and bondhu. All that is going on in the government is Chanda lo, Chanda do,” Barman said, implying widespread nepotism and corruption at the highest levels. “The chief minister’s office, director of the health department and everyone else is involved in this unholy nexus,” he added. Barman called for a clarification on the land allocation from the chief minister’s office. “Such massive corruption cannot be tolerated. I will wait for the CM’s clarification and hope that those involved with this decision refrain from proceeding,” Barman said. “As the Opposition, we are the watchdogs of the Constitution. We must raise issues of significant corruption, and this is a glaring example,” he added. Barman said that state Congress president Ashish Kumar Saha had instructed him to file a PIL petition in the Tripura High Court in the matter soon. ‘Good man’s mask is coming off’ In a veiled reference to purportedly changing political dynamics, Barman said the BJP should be wary of the implications of the Haryana Assembly election results, due on October 8. Ashish Kumar Saha echoed Barman’s sentiments, stating, “The good man’s mask is slowly coming off. Corruption, lawlessness, and illegal activities are being orchestrated in Tripura, just like in the rest of the country. Good governance has become a joke, and people are now demanding accountability for the promises made to them.” In response to the allegations, Food and Civil Supplies Minister Sushanta Chowdhury, who also serves as the cabinet spokesperson, dismissed the claims as a conspiracy to mislead the public and tarnish the Government’s reputation. He explained that the government has a policy to provide land to investors interested in sectors such as agriculture, industry, health, and education. “In such cases, there is no need for a tender or expression of interest, as per the rules,” he said. Chowdhury defended the decision to allocate land to Shija Hospitals and Research Institute, which has been operational since 1985 and runs a 350-bed super-speciality hospital in Imphal. He said the hospital expressed interest in establishing a super-speciality facility in the state in December last year. “It is the first super-speciality hospital operated by someone from the Northeast. Hospital land can’t be given to anyone at the drop of a hat. We had earlier provided 15-acre land to Cachar Cancer Hospital for a hospital at Dharmanagar in North Tripura. The erstwhile government provided land to ILS Hospitals at Agartala. Hospitals, super-speciality hospitals, colleges, and universities will naturally come up in the state during our development journey,” he said. The minister said Barman had hurried to claim that land was given to Shija Hospitals without cabinet approval, adding that the process had been going on for the past one year for a Rs 900-crore investment in the next few years. “After searching for suitable land, we decided to provide some land from a lot of vacant unused land lying with the ARD at Bodhjungnagar. The DM and collector approached the ARD director for an NOC and the director forwarded the file to the minister concerned via a secretary, after which the NOC was provided for the land through the revenue department. Approval from the cabinet will be procured after the entire process is over,” Chowdhury said. Chowdhury also said the no-objection certificate did not mean the land had already been handed over, adding that the cabinet approval would be accorded after the issue is raised in the cabinet.","category":"india"},{"publishedAt":"2024-10-07","title":"80% of looted arms in Ukhrul violence recovered: Manipur Police","description":"Inspector General of Police I K Muivah said direct confrontation between the sparring parties ceased since Wednesday evening.","urlToImage":"https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/10/Manipur-police-.jpg?w=640","content":"The Manipur Police recently said 80 per cent of weapons and ammunition looted from Ukhrul police station on Wednesday have been recovered.

On Thursday afternoon, the pair had sent out an SOS call and waited in the biting cold, scanning the skies for a miracle, before finally encountering a French expedition team. The French climbers, already on a mission in the Chaukhamba region, diverted their route to locate the missing duo with coordinates provided by rescue authorities. They reached the stranded women on Saturday, and relayed their location to the Indian Air Force, which rescued them on Sunday morning. The two mountaineers had been ascending a rocky section of the mountain when they got stranded. British alpinist Fay Manners (right) with her fellow mountaineer Michelle Dvorak. (Photo: Instagram/Michelle Dvorak) As per sources familiar with the situation, Manners and Dvorak were following a method commonly used on difficult ascents — tying their shared kit bag with a rope, climbing ahead, and then pulling the bag up once they reached a stable spot. However, while pulling the bag, a rockfall severed the rope, sending the bag, along with crucial supplies like their food, tent, and climbing gear, tumbling into a gorge. They lost most of their communication equipment, but managed to send out an SOS call. They were then left stranded for the next two days. Rescue operations by the IAF, the State Disaster Response Force (SDRF), and the Indian Mountaineering Foundation (IMF) began early on Friday, but the terrain of Chaukhamba-III presented numerous challenges. Located in Uttarakhand’s Chamoli district, the peak is known for its treacherous glaciated sections, steep ice and rock faces, and thin air at high altitudes, making it extremely difficult for helicopters to reach. The helicopters made several rounds over the general area on Friday and Saturday without success. The climbers were likely watching the aerial search unfold but were unable to signal the rescue teams, as they had lost all equipment, including any flashlights, flare guns, or smoke candles. But the breakthrough came thanks to a French expedition team also operating in the Chaukhamba area. On hearing about the missing alpinists, the French team diverted their expedition and set out to locate Manners and Dvorak, using the coordinates shared by rescue officials. On Saturday, they found the two climbers, confirming their position and relaying the information to Indian rescue teams. “When the French team learned about the missing mountaineers, they decided to assist,” said a source from the SDRF. “They altered their course and located the duo based on the coordinates we provided.” As the SDRF teams mobilised on the ground, the Indian Army’s aerial team, conducting a parallel reconnaissance mission, finally rescued the two women on Sunday morning. The climbers were airlifted to the Joshimath helipad by an Army helicopter and were reported to be in good health. Commander Arpan Yaduvanshi of the SDRF confirmed that the ground rescue teams, which had been scouring treacherous sections of the mountain, were also safely airlifted back to Joshimath later in the day. “The SDRF team that was advancing beyond the Advance Base Camp at 4,900 metres is also being flown back,” Yaduvanshi said. The rescue operation highlighted the challenges posed by high-altitude mountaineering rescues. At altitudes above 6,000 metres, helicopters face reduced air density, which limits their ability to hover, land, or deploy rescuers. Manners, a seasoned alpinist with a string of first ascents in the Alps and beyond, had embarked on this expedition with Dvorak in mid-September, starting from Delhi.","category":"india"},{"publishedAt":"2024-10-07","title":"Monsoon 2024 reports highest number of very-heavy and extremely-heavy rainfall events in last 5 years","description":"The ‘end of monsoon report’ recently published by the India Meteorological Department (IMD) stated that there were 2,632 very-heavy rainfall events and 473 extremely-heavy rainfall events in 2024","urlToImage":"https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/10/delhi-rainfall-3.jpeg?w=640","content":"The Southwest Monsoon recorded the maximum number of very-heavy and extremely-heavy rainfall events this year in the last five years.

Occurrence of extreme events in last five monsoons In 2023, which was officially a drought year, the country recorded 2,321 very-heavy rainfall events and 421 extremely-heavy rainfall events. If recorded rainfall is between 115.6 mm and 204.5 mm in 24 hours, IMD classifies it as very-heavy rainfall. Similarly, more than 204.5 mm of rainfall in 24 hours is defined as extremely-heavy rainfall. The monsoon period officially starts in the country on June 1 and ends on September 30. But the long tail of the retreating monsoon often stretches beyond September. Anupam Kashyapi, former head of weather forecasting, IMD, said the rise in the number of extreme events is a combination of various factors. “La Nina, the cold ocean current in the Pacific, was active from August onwards, leading to robust rainfall. Also, every year, the monsoon comes with its inter-annual variability, which, this year, was reflected in the increase in the number of extreme events. However, climate change can also be a reason…” he added.","category":"india"},{"publishedAt":"2024-10-07","title":"BJP stoking communal tensions in Goa, its attempts will not go unchallenged: Rahul","description":"\"BJP's attempts will not go unchallenged.

The District Disaster Management Centre said British alpinist Fay Manners and her fellow mountaineer Michelle Dvorak (31), a climate science PhD student from Washington, USA, were rescued after being stuck for two days while on their way to the Chaukhamba III peak. The National Disaster Response Force (NDRF), State Disaster Response Force (SDRF), and the Indian Air Force have been involved in the rescue operations since Friday, with the latter dispatching two helicopters. According to Vijendra Kuriyal, the SDRF additional sub-inspector who is part of the rescue team, the duo, who started their expedition from Delhi with a liaison officer from the Indian Mountaineering Foundation on September 15, were able to send out a distress signal on Thursday afternoon before all communication was lost. It was this signal that eventually alerted the district administration of the situation. For rescuers, the challenge was battling the combined forces of high-altitude conditions and the difficult terrain of Chaukhamba-III. With freezing night-time temperatures posing a serious threat to the climbers’ survival, the concern was to get to them in time. The more experienced of the two, Manners was the first woman to ascend the Phantom Direct route on the south face of the Grand Jorasses in 2022, as well climb renowned alpine routes such as the North Face of the Eiger in the Bernese Oberland of Switzerland and the Cassin Ridge on Denali, Alaska.

The five key points of the party manifesto were announced by Jharkhand BJP chief Babulal Marandi in the presence of Assam CM Himanta Biswa Sarma, Union Ministers Annapurna Devi and Shivraj Singh Chouhan among others. “BJP will launch ‘gogo Didi Yojana’, under which financial assistance up to Rs 2,100 will be transferred to the bank account of every woman in Jharkhand on the 11th of every month. We will also launch ‘Laxmi Johar Yojana’ under which we will provide LPG gas cylinders to all households at Rs 500, besides two free cylinders in a year,” Marandi said. He said the BJP will start “assured employment” in the state, under which five lakh self-employment opportunities will be created for the youth in five years. “Apart from this, fair and transparent recruitment will be done for 2.87 lakh vacant government posts,” Marandi said. We aim to achieve 1.5 lakh recruitments by November 2025,” Marandi said. He said the party will address the challenges of youth “struggling to start their career”. “For this, we will give ‘Yuva Sathi’ allowance of Rs 2,000 per month to every (unemployed) graduate and postgraduate for two years.” ExplainedFinancial assistance pledge & pollsThe promise of financial assistance to women in poll-bound states is not new. In Haryana, both Congress and BJP have pledged monthly `2,000 and `2,100 respectively to women. In J&K, the BJP has promised `18,000 per year to the senior-most woman in every household and the Congress pledged `3,000 per month to the woman head of the family. The Jharkhand BJP also promised to launch ‘Ghar Saakar’ programme, under which it will provide free sand for the construction of houses.

The protests demanding Velingkar’s arrest erupted Friday as over 300 people gathered outside the police station in Margao, including several leaders from Congress and AAP. On Saturday, protesters blocked roads in Margao, Anjuna and Old Goa. Police resorted to a mild lathi-charge to disperse protesters in Margao. The protesters also issued an ultimatum, threatening to block Zuari bridge if the accused was not arrested soon. Goa CM Pramod Sawant appealed to the people to maintain peace and not to block roads. Sawant said, “Whatever action was taken [in the case] against Fr Bolmax [Pereira], similar action will be applied for Velingkar.” Fr Bolmax Pereira, the parish priest of St Francis Xavier Church, Chicalim in South Goa, was booked last year for allegedly hurting religious sentiments for his alleged derogatory remarks about Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj during a sermon. The Congress in a statement said, “Goa has a unique identity of communal harmony, peace and respect for all traditions and culture. It is the responsibility of the government to ensure that this sensitive fabric of sharing love and affection with each other is preserved.” BJP Siolim MLA Delilah Lobo said, “St Francis Xavier is a saint revered by people from all religions. People like Velingkar make such stupid statements just to come in the limelight. They want to create a rift between religions.” Earlier this week, Velingkar had called for a “DNA test” of the relics of St Francis Xavier and said that the saint could not be called “Goencho Saib” (the protector of Goa).","category":"india"},{"publishedAt":"2024-10-07","title":"No strangers to tough ascents, 2 women mountaineers stranded in Uttarakhand now await a miraculous rescue","description":"According to SDRF head constable Ravi Chauhan, who is part of the rescue efforts, it is possible that the missing climbers had seen the helicopters but had no means of signalling their own positions effectively.","urlToImage":"https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/10/trap.jpg?w=640","content":"Over the past year, British alpinist Fay Manners has made eight significant first ascents — from the Pakistan’s Trango II with its demanding “Waa Shakil” trek to being the first to ascend “Mental Breakdown”, a 765-metre rock climbing route on Father Tower in Greenland’s Mythic Cirque. But it is her latest trek to Chaukhamba-III, one of the four peaks of the Chaukhamba massif in Uttarakhand’s Garhwal Himalayas, that’s proving to be her greatest challenge. For the last two days, Manners (37) and her fellow mountaineer Michelle Dvorak (31), a climate science PhD student from Washington, USA, have been stranded at an altitude of 6,300 metres after losing all their major equipment. The National Disaster Response Force (NDRF), State Disaster Response Force (SDRF), and the Indian Air Force have been involved in the rescue operations since Friday, with the latter dispatching two helicopters. According to Vijendra Kuriyal, the SDRF additional sub-inspector who is part of the rescue team, the duo, who started their expedition from Delhi with a liaison officer from the Indian Mountaineering Foundation on September 15, were able to send out a distress signal on Thursday afternoon before all communication was lost. It was this signal that eventually alerted the district administration of the situation. SDRF teams leaving for the search and rescue operation. “We’ve been informed that during the alpine trek, they were pulling up their kit which had important things such as food, tent, climbing gear, and other technical equipment, but the bag fell and was lost. After that, they were able to send an SOS call on Thursday afternoon, which was the last communication with them. Because of all the important equipment lost, they cannot continue with the trek and are essentially stuck,” Kuriyal told The Indian Express. For rescuers, the challenge is significant, having to battle the combined forces of high-altitude conditions and the difficult terrain of Chaukhamba-III, which no member of the rescue teams has ever climbed. At the time of filing this report, IAF helicopters had already made three-four rounds of the general area with no success, officials said. According to SDRF head constable Ravi Chauhan, who is part of the rescue efforts, it is possible that the missing climbers had seen the helicopters but had no means of signalling their own positions effectively. “They likely don’t have any flashlights, smoke candles, or flare guns to signal. The difficulty we face is that helicopters can’t easily reach such high altitudes due to low air pressure, and there’s no safe place to land or hover long enough to drop rescuers,” said Chauhan. With freezing night-time temperatures posing a serious threat to the climbers’ survival, the concern now is to get to them in time. But officials hope that the mountaineers’ past climbing experience and survival skills will give teams just enough time to reach them. The more experienced of the two, Manners was the first woman to ascend the Phantom Direct route on the south face of the Grand Jorasses in 2022, as well climb renowned alpine routes such as the North Face of the Eiger in the Bernese Oberland of Switzerland and the Cassin Ridge on Denali, Alaska. SDRF Commandant Arpan Yaduvanshi said a four-member team had reached the Advance Base Camp at 4,900 metres and would begin trekking toward the coordinates (at around 6,300 metres) where Manners and Dvorak are believed to be stranded. “The team will try to locate the climbers if they are attempting to return. They’ll also be searching for the closest possible spot for a helicopter landing to complete the rescue operation,” Yaduvanshi said, adding that another SDRF team remains on standby in Joshimath, while a backup team is being flown to the Advance Base Camp via IAF helicopters. But he also expressed concern over the tight window for the rescue operation, stating that the team had yet to fully acclimatise to the extreme altitude. “Acclimatisation is critical in such operations, and while our team is experienced, they won’t be able to function in these conditions for long. We have to complete the operation within three-four days,” he said. Chamoli District Magistrate Sandeep Tewari said that additional assistance has been requested from the Nehru Institute of Mountaineering in Uttarkashi. One of the four peaks of the Chaukhamba massif in Uttarakhand’s Garhwal Himalayas, Chaukhamba-III stands at an elevation of 6,995 metres. Unlike the more accessible trekking peaks, Chaukhamba-III presents significant challenges due to its steep slopes, rock and ice sections, and unpredictable weather. The remote location and difficult terrain mean that very few mountaineers attempt it.","category":"india"},{"publishedAt":"2024-10-07","title":"How security forces struck deep inside hostile territory to conduct Chhattisgarh’s largest anti-Naxal op","description":"It was this pinpoint coordination that went into the single largest Maoist encounter in Chhattisgarh’s 24-year history — the toll stood at 31 on Saturday — conducted without the security forces suffering a single casualty.","urlToImage":"https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/10/maoistOpguns-4col.jpg?w=640","content":"Smruthik Rajanala (32), the Additional Superintendent of Police (Naxal operations), Dantewada, had his work cut out. He was to lead over 100 personnel to execute a meticulous plan of reaching a Maoist hideout — deep inside hostile territory — in 12 hours, covering a distance of 16 kilometres in pitch darkness without raising an alarm. He was to coordinate with his counterpart, Deputy SP Prashant Dewangan, and his team coming in from Narayanpur, as well as the Special Task Force, to surround the Maoists before the first ray of sunlight could alert them. It was this pinpoint coordination that went into the single largest Maoist encounter in Chhattisgarh’s 24-year history — the toll stood at 31 on Saturday — conducted without the security forces suffering a single casualty. Importantly, it came deep inside Abujhmad, long considered a Maoist stronghold and a key focus area in the fight against Naxalism. Also Read | The importance of Abujhmad, where 31 Maoists were gunned down yesterday In fact, of the 188 Maoists killed this year, at least 100 have been gunned down in Abujhmad, police say. Inspector General of Police for Bastar Range, Sundarraj P, told The Indian Express that close to 50 anti-Maoist operations were undertaken this year as part of “Maad Bachao Abhiyan (Save Maad campaign)” — including nine major operations since April. “This year, a series of anti-Naxal operations were conducted in the core of Abhujmad as well as in its periphery. These operations have dealt a significant blow to Maoist activities in the region. The objective is to ensure Maoists don’t get any safe zone in Abhujmad or any other region in Bastar. Now their leadership and cadres are left with only one option – to shun violence and join the mainstream,” he said. Security forces now claim to have covered about 50 percent of Abujhmad — a largely unsurveyed land that’s bigger than Goa. A while before Friday’s encounter was planned, the State Intelligence Branch (SIB) had provided the security forces specific inputs on the presence of senior Maoist cadres around Tultuli village in Abujhmad, approximately 50 kilometres from Dantewada headquarters. It was suspected that members of company number 6 and platoon 16 of the People’s Liberation Guerrilla Army (PLGA) — an armed wing of the banned Communist Party of India (Maoists) — and senior members of the Dandakaranya Special Zonal Committee (DKSZC) were present there. A coordinated attack was planned by the District Reserve Guards (DRG) from Narayanpur and Dantewada districts, along with the STF. The biggest challenge was to launch an operation across Indravati river, where there are no police camps. Bodies of Maoists killed in an encounter with security forces personnel, placed at the Police Line in Dantewada on Saturday. (PTI Photo) According to sources, the security personnel trekked the distance on an amavas (no moon) night, and had to be mindful not to step on improvised explosive devices, the most dangerous weapon in the Maoist arsenal. “The DRG jawans have been part of many deadly encounters and their experience of conducting night operations was a big advantage. They carried 10-15 kg of material on their shoulders. Due to the monsoon, water in the river and the nullahs had not receded, adding to the difficulties of walking in hilly terrain, but our jawans showed bravery,” said SP, Dantewada, Gaurav Rai. ASP Rajanala told The Indian Express, “My biggest challenge was to keep my men motivated as we knew the enemy is strong and heavy fire is expected. The company number 6 of PLGA is their (Communist Party of India Maoist’s) second best team after battalion 1. We knew the firepower they had and one mistake could lead to many casualties.” Also Read | What’s behind the spike in Maoist casualties in Chhattisgarh this year? Before sunrise, the forces managed to surround the Maoists, forming a circle with a circumference of 5-6 kilometres. The encounter began around Friday noon and firing went on for seven to eight hours, ending only at 8 pm. Over 2,000 bullets and hundreds of grenades were fired at the security forces, officials said. A jawan suffered a splinter injury and was evacuated from the spot. According to sources, the rebels made a single formation and tried to squeeze out by continuously firing on one side of the security cordon, but the forces retaliated and foiled the attempt. By Saturday, 15 Maoists had been identified, with officials saying they have a total bounty of Rs 1.3 crore on them. A senior police officer said these Naxals – 18 men and 31 women – were involved in killing around 50 jawans in Bastar over the past two decades. The most high profile name is Niti alias Urmila, a DKSZC member and former east Bastar division in charge, with a bounty of Rs 25 lakh. She is the fourth DKSZC member to have been killed this year. Aged around 46, Niti had been part of the Naxal organisation since 1998. DKSZC is the Naxals’ state-level committee and is third in the hierarchy, below the central level committee and the politburo. An LMG, four AK57 rifles, six SLR rifles, three INSAS rifles and two .303 rifles were recovered from the Naxals, apart from rifles of other calibre rifles and locally made weapons, including grenade launchers. Sundarraj said that in 2024, security forces have “succeeded in neutralising 188 Naxals”, while 706 have been arrested and 733 have surrendered.","category":"india"},{"publishedAt":"2024-10-07","title":"PM Modi flags off Mumbai’s first underground Metro line, takes a ride","description":"Narendra Modi criticised the previous MVA government for delaying the Metro 3 project for two and a half years, which he claimed increased its cost by Rs 14,000 crore.","urlToImage":"https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/10/PM-METRO.jpg?w=640","content":"Eight years in the making, Mumbai Saturday finally got its first underground Metro with PM Narendra Modi inaugurating the first phase of the Aqua Line Metro, a 12.44-km stretch that will run from Aarey to Bandra Kurla Complex (BKC).

Chief Secretary TVSN Prasad said that the polling was smooth barring some stray incidents of clashes in some places between supporters of rival candidates. As per the Election Commission data, state had recorded 66.49 per cent polling till midnight. The figure was likely to increase once the final tally comes in, officials said. In the 2019 Assembly polls, Haryana had recorded 68.31 per cent polling, much lower than 76.54 per cent in 2014 when the BJP had ousted the Congress and formed the government with absolute majority. In the Lok Sabha polls earlier this year for 10 seats, the percentage was 64.8. A total of 1,031 candidates are in the fray. Counting will be taken up on October 8. Speaking to reporters after the exit poll predictions, Congress leader and former chief minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda claimed that Haryana has made up its mind “to oust the BJP”. “Congress is going to form the government with a thumping majority,” said Hooda, who is seeking re-election from Garhi Sampla-Kiloi in Rohtak district. Chief Minister Nayab Singh Saini too asserted the BJP will form the government for a third time with a big mandate. “Haryana was made free from ‘kshetravad’ (regional bias), ‘parivarvaad’, and discrimination against the state,” Saini said. Hooda hit back. “They (BJP) will come to know once results are out. When people sought an account (of the works done) from them, they changed their chief minister. But people decided to change the government”. Besides Hooda and Saini, the big names in the fray include BJP’s Anil Vij and O P Dhankar, Congress’s Vinesh Phogat, INLD’s Abhay Singh Chautala and JJP’s Dushyant Chautala. A few incidents of violence were reported from Meham where Independent candidate Balraj Kundu accused former MLA Anand Singh Dangi of assaulting him and his assistant at a polling booth.

This will be a constructive campaign with the sole objective to improve workplace wellness for all professionals in the country,” Chakravarty said. As the first step, people can share their experiences of workplace stress and also offer suggestions for improvement. “They can do this by going to www.profcongress.in/speakup. After collecting these voices across the nation, we will convene an expert group to develop comprehensive draft guidelines for offices across India to improve workplace conditions. AIPC will then hold public consultations with professionals and their parents in all major cities to discuss the draft guidelines,” Chakravarty said. He said as the final step, the Leader of the Opposition will help raise this in Parliament for a constructive discussion on the guidelines and urge the government to pass a law. Chakravarty said he hopes the tragedy of Anna Sebastian will serve as a wake-up call for the nation to prioritise healthy workplaces and better working conditions for all professionals. He also said that Anita Augustine summoned immense courage and published a very emotional letter on September 18 describing the details of her daughter’s death due to heavy stress at the workplace. “She only wanted one thing – to improve working conditions for all professionals and prevent future Anna type situations in the office,” he said. Referring to the AIPC’s programme, Rahul Gandhi in a post on X wrote, “Millions of professionals across India are facing the same stress and pressure that Anna Sebastian experienced.

Before that, the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs will roll out a pilot project in 25 cities targeting construction workers, gig workers, waste management workers, care workers, domestic workers and transportation workers. The preparations for the pilot project started this week, with the enumeration of vulnerable households expected to start after Diwali next month, it is learnt. According to officials, data of the National Food Security Act beneficiaries, the Labour Ministry’s e-Shram portal of unorganised sector workers and the Building and Other Construction Workers Board databases from states will be used as the starting-off point. Cities will then carry out socio-economic profiling and enumeration. While the number of urban poor among NFSA beneficiaries is estimated to be around 18 crore, sources said the estimated beneficiaries of the pilot project and the new mission will only be known after the data is validated on the ground by cities. The pilot project is aiming to cover 50,000 households in three months, it is learnt.

Hours later, the Union Ministry of Mines issued a sharp rebuttal, also on X, calling Agarwal’s remarks “completely misleading” and “incorrect”. “Could you run a business successfully if you have to share more than 100% of your revenue with another party? I doubt if anyone would say yes. But this is the reality of India’s iron ore industry today. And it is dying,” Agarwal’s post began. He argued that although the government introduced the auction regime to increase transparency in mining, the limited number of blocks on offer, coupled with competition from steel manufacturers, is creating a ‘huge demand-supply mismatch,’ driving bids sky-high. “The bid is based on how much revenue you will share with the government. Since auctions were introduced, the average for iron ore is 118%,” Agarwal claimed. Roughly twelve hours later, the mines ministry dismissed Agarwal’s remarks as “completely misleading”. “No mining company in India shares 100% of company revenue with the Government,” its official X account said. The post clarified that auction bids determine the monthly premium a company pays to the state government as a percentage of the average ex-mine price of iron ore, excluding expenditure on logistics and on value addition for steel production. “Auction premium is not paid out of total revenue of the company,” the ministry said. Auction premiums surge While the ministry correctly pointed out that auction premiums are applied to the average ex-mine price of iron ore, not a mining company’s total revenue, premiums for blocks auctioned since 2016 have risen sharply. High auction premiums strain profit margins, especially for mining companies not integrated with downstream value chains. Since the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Amendment Act, 2015 introduced the auction regime, 121 iron ore blocks have been auctioned across India. Of these, 35 blocks requiring further exploration were awarded under composite licences (CL). For the remaining 86 blocks awarded under mining leases (ML), the average auction premium stands at 119 per cent, according to an analysis of official auction data by The Indian Express. This figure has surged over the years—from 86 per cent for the first eight blocks auctioned in 2016 to a whopping 171 per cent for the most recent 16 blocks auctioned in 2023. Blocks on offer have grown In response to Agarwal’s claim of a demand-supply mismatch due to limited auctioned blocks driving up premiums, the mines ministry countered that 17 blocks are currently under auction, with 60 more handed over to state governments. “It is therefore wrong to say that only limited blocks are on offer,” the post said. Between 2020 to 2023, the ministry auctioned 97 iron ore blocks compared to 24 blocks in the preceding four years. In the four years prior to 2016, before the auction regime was introduced, only four blocks were allotted to mining companies. In 2024, however, no blocks have been auctioned yet. Still, the number of available blocks has significantly increased under the auction regime. However, experts argue that offering even more blocks could help cool premiums, providing relief to smaller mining companies and those not integrated with downstream operations. The ministry also noted that India’s iron ore production has risen from 129 million tonnes (MT) in FY15 to 274 MT in FY24. “India produced 144 million tonnes of steel in FY 2023-24 for which iron ore requirement was easily met and additionally 46 million tonnes of iron ore was exported by India. Thus, there is no shortage of iron ore in the country to support the iron and steel production,” it added. Hurts non-captive mines A 2023 market study by the Competition Commission of India (CCI) found that the share of captive mines in the total number of iron ore mines has risen over the years. Steel manufacturers with captive mines can absorb higher auction premiums through value addition, unlike companies operating non-captive mines. “The contribution of iron ore in the cost of steel produced is about 15%. So, in case of a steel company which uses iron ore produced from its own mine, it pays only a small percentage of total value of steel produced as auction premium to secure assured supply of iron ore for running its steel plant,” the ministry said in its post. In contrast, the rising auction premiums squeeze the margins of mining companies not integrated with steel plants or those focused on exports. In FY24, roughly 46 MT of iron ore was exported out of India, which is also the world’s fourth largest producer of the key commodity. The ministry also rejected Agarwal’s recommendation for a 50 per cent cap on auction premiums, stating that “investment in iron ore blocks is low risk project and hence, there is no need to place any cap on iron ore revenue share”. Competition concerns The CCI study also highlighted that large-scale producers gaining control over the iron ore supply chain through captive mines can manage “fluctuations in raw material prices better”. “This has created competition concerns due to differential cost structure amongst steel producers with and without captive mines. It is further observed that the iron ore blocks auctioned after 2015 are dominated by some companies like JSW, which accounts for nearly 47 percent of the total quantity of the reserves auctioned,” the study noted. Of the 4,300 MT of iron ore reserves auctioned under ML since 2016, 35 per cent went to JSW Steel Ltd, 11 per cent to Jindal Steel and Power Ltd—both vertically integrated steel players. Rungta Mines Ltd and Tata Steel Ltd secured 9 per cent and 7 per cent, respectively, while Vedanta Ltd acquired only 94 MT, or about 2 per cent. The remaining 36 per cent of reserves were awarded to various other players, small and large. Slow mine operationalisation “Not surprisingly, most of the blocks have not been operationalised. Operating companies are even considering returning some of the blocks because of unviability,” Agarwal also said in his post. In response, the mines ministry said 34 of the 119 auctioned iron ore blocks have been operationalised, less than 30 per cent. The ministry also expects another 21 blocks to become operational in the near future. “It is incorrect to say that non-operationalisation of blocks is due to high auction premium committed by the bidders during auction. Operationalisation of the blocks requires obtaining various statutory clearances such as environment clearance, forest clearance, etc. and land acquisition which normally takes 3-7 years time after auction, depending on level of exploration of the block. Since, most of the blocks have been auctioned during the last 3 years, it will take another 2-5 years to operationalise these blocks,” the ministry said.","category":"business"},{"publishedAt":"2024-10-07","title":"Malls need to be ‘more humane’ towards delivery partners: Zomato CEO hits out","description":"The Zomato CEO and his wife Grecia Munoz, who changed her name to Gia Goyal on Instagram, earlier took on the role of delivery partners to deliver orders in Gurugram and get a first-hand experience of challenges faced by them.","urlToImage":"https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/10/Zomato-Ceo.jpg?w=640","content":"Zomato CEO Deepinder Goyal on Sunday said malls need to be “more humane” towards delivery partners, sharing his first-hand experience as a delivery executive picking up orders for the food tech giant.

On the other hand, investors have become even richer in SME IPOs with an average gain of 92 per cent during the six-month period, says a study. Propelled by strong listing performance, the average listing gain (based on closing price on listing date) increased to 34.28 per cent when compared to 28.65 per cent in the first half of 2023-24, according to a study on IPOs by Prime Database. Of the 38 IPOs which have got listed thus far, 30 IPOs gave a return of over 10 per cent. An investor who got 200 shares at Rs 70 in Bajaj Housing Finance IPO has seen its market value more than doubling to Rs 150. As many as 30 of the 38 IPOs are trading above the issue price as on September 30. Bajaj Housing Finance gave a stupendous return of 136 per cent on listing day followed by Unicommerce Esolutions (94 per cent) and Premier Energies (87 per cent). As many as 30 of the 38 IPOs are trading above the issue price (closing price of 30th September, 2024). The average gain of the 38 IPOs till September 2024 has been a huge 41.80 per cent, according to Pranav Haldea, Managing Director, Prime Database Group. The BSE Sensex gained nearly 10 per cent since April 2024. Significantly, of the 38 IPOs for which data is available presently, 35 IPOs received a mega response of more than 10 times (of which 17 IPOs more than 50 times) while two IPOs were oversubscribed by more than 3 times. According to Haldea, investor enthusiasm can be gauged from the fact that, across categories, the average oversubscription stood at 53.72 times as against 31.25 times in the same period last year. Average retail oversubscription stood at 33.02 times in comparison to 28.27 times last year. Further, when compared to the first half of 2023-24, the response of retail investors increased tremendously. The average number of applications from retail more than doubled to 20.91 lakh in the first half of 2023-24, in comparison to 9.67 lakh in the same period last year. The highest number of applications from retail were received by Bajaj Housing Finance (58.66 lakhs) followed by Arkade Developers (45.37 lakhs) and Northern Arc (45.13 lakhs). The value of shares bid by retail investors was Rs 1.58 lakh crore, which is 211 per cent higher than the total IPO mobilisation (in comparison to being 124 per cent higher in 2023-24) again showing a much higher level of enthusiasm from retail during the period. However, the total allocation to retail, however, was only Rs 11,976 crore which was 24 per cent of the total IPO mobilisation (slightly down from 25 per cent in 2023-24), it said. As many as 40 Indian corporates raised Rs 51,365 crore through main board IPOs in the first half of 2024-25, 95 per cent higher than the Rs 26,311 crore mobilized by 31 IPOs in the same period in 2023-24, according to Prime Database. According to Haldea, adding the Rs 66,225 crore raised through QIPs (195 per cent higher than Rs 22,443 crore raised in the same period last year), contributed to a significant share of the overall public equity fundraising of Rs 1,56,947 crore, an increase of 102 per cent from Rs 77,744 crore raised in the first half of 2023-24. As many as 22 out of the 40 IPOs came in just the 2 months of August and September. The highest mobilisation was from the Housing Finance sector at Rs 9,560 crore or 19 per cent of the issue amount. The first half of 2024-25 saw huge 84 companies filing their offer document with SEBI for approval (in comparison to 40 in the first half of 2023-24). On the other hand, in the same period, three companies looking to raise nearly Rs 7,500 crore let their approval lapse, four companies looking to raise Rs 13,450 crore withdrew their offer document and SEBI returned the offer document of a further eight companies looking to raise Rs 15,500 crore, Prime said. The pipeline for new IPOs is huge. As many as 26 companies proposing to raise Rs 72,000 crore are presently holding SEBI approval while another 55 companies looking to raise about Rs 89,000 crore are awaiting SEBI approval (Out of these 81 companies, 3 are NATCs which are looking to raise roughly Rs 13,000 crore). “Unless there is a black swan event, it is likely to be a record-breaking year for IPOs,” Haldea said. Activity in the SME segment saw a huge increase in the first half of 2024-25 with 143 SME IPOs collecting a total of Rs 4,948 crore, 83 per cent higher than Rs 2,724 crore from 96 IPOs in the same period last year. “The response of retail investors has also increased tremendously. The average number of applications from retail increased to 1.94 lakh in comparison to just 468 applications 5 years back (first half of 2019-20),” it said. The average listing gain (based on closing price on listing date) in SME IPOs increased to 63 per cent in comparison to 41 per cent in the first half of 2023-24. As many as 94 of the 131 SME IPOs are trading above the issue price (closing price of September 30, 2024). The average gain till September 30, 2024 has been a huge 92 per cent. The average oversubscription for SME IPOs across categories stood at 208 times in comparison to 72 times in the same period last year.

Jaishankar said on Sunday that one of the impacts of globalisation over the past 25 years has been job losses and dissatisfaction with the quality of life in many societies, as trade has not only been globalised but also weaponised. Speaking at the Kautilya Economic Conclave here, the minister stated that the conflicts in Ukraine and West Asia have shifted the focus of global politics away from crucial issues such as reforms of Multilateral Development Banks (MDBs), climate change, and the India–Middle East–Europe Economic Corridor (IMEC), which was conceptualised during the G20 meeting in India last year. “On the one hand, the world is becoming more deeply globalised, with supply chains increasingly transnational. Hardly anything significant is made entirely in one country anymore, except perhaps in very large nations. This has led to increased interdependence. On the other hand, there is a social and political backlash against globalisation because the way it has been managed over the past 25 years has resulted in job losses and dissatisfaction with quality of life in many societies, which has, in turn, influenced politics,” Jaishankar said. Rising protectionism Jaishankar’s comments come a week after steep US tariffs on China took effect amid concerns that a fresh wave of Chinese products in clean energy and high-tech sectors – dubbed China Shock 2.0 – could cause job losses in several regions, including India. The first shock occurred when cheap Chinese goods flooded global markets following China’s entry into the WTO in 2001, resulting in job losses worldwide. In response to protective measures abroad, India has also increased anti-subsidy measures on Chinese products. In 2024 alone, India imposed over 30 anti-dumping measures against China, the highest number for any country. The targeted products include industrial items such as plastic processing machines, vacuum-insulated flasks, welded stainless steel pipes and tubes, soft ferrite cores, and industrial laser machines, among others. Indian businesses seeking multiple extensions of anti-dumping duties argue that China is not a market economy and harms Indian industries by employing predatory methods to eliminate competition. “Trade is not just globalised; it’s also weaponized. When trade and finance are weaponized, countries take defensive measures. This is one of the reasons for protectionism or, at the very least, for caution regarding supply chains. National security has become a pervasive lens through which economic transactions are now viewed. As economic transactions increasingly involve technology, this national security filter will only grow stronger,” Jaishankar said. He added that countries are willing to compromise economic efficiency for the sake of national security, privacy protection, and, in some cases, keeping jobs at home, as the narrative of job losses is a powerful one in many regions. “So, in essence, the realities of globalisation are going to clash with the forces of protectionism,” he said. IMEC & MDB reforms Jaishankar also reiterated that the conflicts in Ukraine and West Asia have diverted global political attention from critical issues such as MDB reforms and climate change. “Tomorrow marks exactly a year since the terrorist attacks on Israel, and as a result, the focus we expected on the IMEC has not materialised. However, this does not mean that the IMEC is dead, discarded, or even shelved. I’ve visited both Saudi Arabia and the UAE, and we currently have ongoing projects with the UAE on IMEC, as well as feasibility studies initiated with Saudi Arabia,” he said. He further noted that with rising risks due to the proliferation of various technologies and other factors, the case for IMEC has only grown stronger, and India expects the development of the corridor to accelerate. “The reality is that in global politics, there is limited bandwidth. One or two issues tend to dominate the agenda. Over the past two and a half years, it has been Ukraine, and over the past year, the Middle East. During my meetings with G20 colleagues at the UN General Assembly (UNGA), I have to admit that the expected push for MDB reforms was lacking. Instead, the Middle East was the top priority, followed by Ukraine, and even climate change has dropped in importance,” Jaishankar said.","category":"business"},{"publishedAt":"2024-10-07","title":"RBI policy: Why MPC may keep repo rate steady but could cut in December?","description":"Many economists believe that the six-member MPC may change the monetary policy stance from ‘withdrawal of accommodation’ to ‘neutral’ in the policy meeting next week.","urlToImage":"https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/10/RBI_2c0091.jpg?w=640","content":"The Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) newly reconstituted Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), which is scheduled to meet from October 7-9, is likely to keep the key policy rate – repo rate – unchanged at 6.5 per cent. This would be the tenth consecutive monetary policy when the repo rate would have been left untouched. However, analysts are of the view that the RBI will cut the repo rate in its December policy. Many economists believe that the six-member MPC may change the monetary policy stance from ‘withdrawal of accommodation’ to ‘neutral’ in the policy meeting next week. Will RBI change repo rate in the upcoming policy? While a large number of economists expect the RBI’s rate-setting panel, which will announce its decision on October 9, to leave the repo rate unchanged, a few see a reduction of 25 basis points (bps). One basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. “RBI is expected to maintain status quo on policy rates in October policy. Policy space to remain on pause is provided by growth conditions which have held-up,” said Gaura Sen Gupta, Chief Economist, IDFC FIRST Bank. The risk on food inflation is not yet abated with daily retail prices indicating a rise in vegetable prices. September CPI (consumer price index) inflation print is estimated at 5.2 per cent versus 3.7 per cent in August. Majority of the rise is due to less supportive base-effects. On a month-on-month basis, the estimate builds-in a rise in food prices. The near-term headline CPI inflation trajectory is tracking at near 5 per cent in Q3 FY25, she said. Bank of America’s Economist (India and ASEAN) Rahul Bajoria said the guidance from the RBI for near term growth and inflation dynamics remains upbeat, and that rules out any material risk of a change in monetary policy guidance in the upcoming October MPC meeting. However, Nomura’s Economist Sonal Varma expects a 25 bps repo rate cut versus consensus expectations of a pause. “We attach a 55 per cent probability to a rate cut versus 45 per cent to a hold, acknowledging that this is a close call. We believe inflation is aligned to the 4 per cent target, growth signals are softening, a policy-induced credit slowdown is underway and real rates are high, which provides room to recalibrate policy settings without stoking inflation,” Varma said in a report. Will there be a change in monetary policy stance? Economists are split over the monetary policy stance, with a majority seeing the policy stance changing to ‘neutral’, and a few expecting continuation of ‘withdrawal of accommodation’. “We think it will change its stance from a hawkish ‘withdrawal of accommodation’ to ‘neutral’ in the upcoming 9 October policy meeting,” HSBC’s Chief Economist (India and Indonesia), Pranjul Bhandari said. Bank of America’s Bajoria said the incoming near-term data is much more mixed, and growth risks appear tilted to the downside. “It is possible, that the RBI may also signal greater data dependence going ahead, as real rates remain elevated, and headline inflation is closest to the inflation target it has been in almost twenty-two quarters (on a 4-quarter rolling basis). This opens up the possibility of a shift in stance to neutral as well, if the RBI wants to entertain the idea of a rate cut,” he said. Bank of Baroda’s Economist Aditi Gupta and IDFC’s Sen Gupta, however, see the monetary policy stance of withdrawal of accommodation to be retained. Will RBI revise inflation and GDP projections? In August’s monetary policy, the RBI projected CPI at 4.5 per cent and real gross domestic product (GDP) at 7.2 per cent for FY2025. Nomura’s Economist Sonal Varma expects minor downward revisions to the RBI’s FY25 projections for CPI inflation and GDP growth. “We expect the RBI to lower its Q2 FY25 (July-September) and Q3 FY25 (October- December) CPI inflation forecasts by 0.2 pp (percentage points) and 0.3 pp, respectively, with FY25 CPI inflation likely to be lowered by 0.1pp to 4.4 per cent,” she said. Varma expects the RBI to lower its FY25 (year ending March 2025) GDP growth forecast by 0.2pp to 7 per cent, while maintaining its FY26 forecast at 7 per cent. So, what happens to lending rates if repo rate is left steady? If the RBI leaves the repo rate steady at 6.5 per cent, all external benchmark lending rates (EBLR) linked to the repo rate will not increase, giving relief to borrowers as their equated monthly instalments (EMIs) will not increase. However, lenders may raise interest rates on loans that are linked to the marginal cost of fund-based lending rate (MCLR), where the full transmission of a 250 bps hike in the repo rate between May 2022 and February 2023 has not happened. In response to the 250 bps hike in the policy repo rate since May 2022, banks have revised upwards their repo-linked external benchmark-based lending rates (EBLRs) by a similar magnitude. The one-year median MCLR of banks has increased by 170 bps during May 2022 to August 2024. When is RBI expected to cut repo rate? Economists expect the RBI to deliver the first repo rate cut in December 2024. HSBC’s Bhandari sees repo rate cuts of 25 bps each in the December and February meetings, taking the repo rate to 6 per cent. “Slowing growth and falling inflation offer room for the RBI to cut rates in coming months. We expect repo rate cuts of 100 bps by December 2025, beginning December 2024,” said Bank of America’s Bajoria. Who are the new MPC’s external members? Last week, the government appointed three external members in the MPC — Ram Singh, Director, Delhi School of Economics, University of Delhi; Saugata Bhattacharya, Economist and Nagesh Kumar, Director and Chief Executive, Institute for Studies in Industrial Development. They have replaced the previous external MPC members – Ashima Goyal, professor at the Indira Gandhi Institute of Development Research, Jayanth R Varma, professor IIM-Ahmedabad, and Shashanka Bhide, senior advisor at the National Council of Applied Economic Research – whose tenures ended on October 4.","category":"business"},{"publishedAt":"2024-10-07","title":"With long delays and steep haircuts, chorus for revamping Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code grows louder","description":"In the recent past, various stakeholders, including RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das and the Parliament’s Standing Committee on Finance, also flagged concerns and the need to rethink the IBC's design.","urlToImage":"https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/10/Kant-amitabh.jpg?w=640","content":"India’s G20 Sherpa Amitabh Kant’s call for reforms in India’s insolvency resolution framework to cut delays and boost creditor recovery is latest in the growing chorus for making the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) more effective. Introduced in 2016, the code promised an overhaul of insolvency resolution with the aim to rescue and reorganise distressed companies through a time-bound process, prioritising their survival as going concerns. Eight years on, while the IBC has had a few successes, it is marred by issues like high case backlog, lengthy delays in admission and resolution, and steep haircuts for creditors. In the recent past, various stakeholders, including RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das and the Parliament’s Standing Committee on Finance, also flagged concerns and the need to rethink the IBC’s design. While the IBC has fostered a culture of accountability and credit discipline among debtors, its efficiency is being undermined by procedural delays, shortage of personnel, deviations from key principles, and slow implementation of critical provisions. Procedural delays “We must acknowledge some concerns regarding the present functioning of the IBC, indicating a need for a second generation of reforms. Analysis of IBBI’s (Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India) own data shows that insolvency resolutions at the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) averaged 716 days in FY24, up from 654 days in FY23,” Kant said Monday. The prescribed resolution timeline is 330 days. In February 2024, the Standing Committee on Finance had flagged delays and their impact on the value of stressed assets, and called for a review of the IBC’s design. “…the Committee believe that the design of the Code needs to be reviewed, taking into account the lacunae and roadblocks that have surfaced in implementing the Code so far, so that the very purpose behind its enactment is not defeated. The process of admitting claims also needs to be revisited as huge delays occur at this stage creating a domino effect on the whole resolution process, most critically degeneration of asset value,” the panel said in a report. Das, too, had flagged the delays in January. “More concerning is the fact that, the average time taken for admission of a case during FY21 and FY22 stood at 468 days and 650 days respectively. Such long degree of delays will substantially erode the value of the assets. There are multitude of factors playing out here, namely, the evolving jurisprudence related to the Code; litigatory tactics adopted by some corporate debtors; lack of effective coordination among the creditors; bottlenecks in the judicial infrastructure, etc,” he said. Steep haircuts There is an inverse relationship between resolution time and debt recovery. As of March 31, cases resolved within 330 days saw a recovery rate of 49.2 per cent of admitted claims. For those resolved between 330 and 600 days, the recovery rate was 36 per cent. For those exceeding 600 days, the recovery rate was just 26.1 per cent. Apart from value erosion for creditors, experts argue that delays are pushing outcomes towards liquidation, defeating the process’s raison d’etre. Till March 31, liquidation orders took an average of 673 days, compared to 847 days for resolution plan approvals. Of the total 5,647 proceedings that were closed, 44 per cent ended in liquidation, 17 per cent in resolution plans getting approved, and the remaining were a mix of withdrawals and closures on appeals, review, or settlement. IBBI chairperson Ravi Mital recently said IBC cases take time as it is a creditor-led model, not debtor–led, and “the debtor tries his best to ensure that the case is not admitted”, which leads to late admissions and consequently higher value erosion and haircuts for lenders. “We did a study…when cases are admitted into IBC, they have already lost more than 50 per cent of their value. Now, IBC is not responsible if the creditors bring the cases late. IBC is responsible once a case is brought before (it), and if you look at recovery as a percentage of fair value, we recover 84 per cent,” Mital said. Industry experts agree that admission delays are hurting the process. Abhishek Dafria, Senior Vice President and Group Head, Structured Finance Ratings, at ICRA said: “We continue to find creditors approaching the NCLT to admit a defaulting corporate debtor with substantial delays, which results in significant erosion of assets…IBC is still not seen as the first step to try and ensure that the company remains a going concern. Lenders are taking other approaches before eventually turning to the IBC.” Legal issues While the NCLT should ideally decide on whether a case can be admitted under the IBC within 14 days of an insolvency application, it often takes months and sometimes even over a year to initiate insolvency proceedings. The reason, at least partly, is legal in nature. “When we speak of admission delays, the law says it is 14 days from the date of filing (the application)…Why doesn’t it happen? The Supreme Court has held that (the timeline) is procedural in nature and hence it is directly not mandatory. Possibly, 14 days seems to be a very short duration. Looking at the situation practically in the current environment, our current infrastructure…14 days looks very impractical,” a senior lawyer told The Indian Express. In 2022, the apex court had held that admission within 14 days was not a mandatory provision of the IBC and that the NCLT had discretionary powers on deciding whether or not to admit the insolvency application. This means that the NCLT, instead of considering just the default as the sole basis of admission, should also consider the default’s circumstances and the debtor’s arguments. Kant emphasised the need to “clarify ambiguity on key legal principles,” particularly regarding the supremacy of the Committee of Creditors’ (CoC) commercial judgement and the established priority of claims. “The Rainbow Papers case highlighted the statutory priorities of VAT (Value Added Tax) versus IBC, stating that the CoC cannot secure their own dues at the cost of statutory dues owed to any government. This seems to contradict the legislative intent behind the IBC, which aimed for lower priority for government dues compared to secured lenders and financial institutions. A statutory amendment or reconsideration by a larger bench is required,” Kant said. Human resource crunch It is no secret that the system is choked and understaffed, with NCLT benches grappling with heavy case burden. While there has been an effort from the government to improve the staffing situation, it is still nowhere close to what is needed. In its February report, the Standing Committee on Finance mentioned that the pendency stands at over “20,000 cases in NCLT at the end of every year”, and called for the enhancement of the NCLT’s sanctioned strength. “Apart from the human resource gaps, the Committee would like to highlight that the NCLT is functioning with poor infrastructural setup. The Committee recommend that the Ministry (of Corporate Affairs) should prioritise addressing the requirements of the Tribunal urgently and fill the infrastructural and human capacity gaps without further delay. The Committee believe that equipping the NCLT is a crucial step in improving the implementation of IBC especially in timely resolution of cases,” the report said. The government is already considering amendments to the IBC after a comprehensive review was undertaken last year. According to Kant, India should also consider moves like outsourcing court management for insolvency proceedings to private players. “It is often said that justice delayed is justice denied…there is a need for tribunal process re-engineering. It is essential to minimise judicial bandwidth on administrative matters while opening non-court functions to innovative non-sovereign or private players to deploy technology for improved court management,” he said.","category":"business"},{"publishedAt":"2024-10-07","title":"Long queues, crowded counters at airports as IndiGo hit by network-wide system glitch","description":"The glitch, which IndiGo has described as a “temporary system slowdown”, has also hit the carrier’s website and booking system.","urlToImage":"https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/10/Indigo-glitch.jpg?w=640","content":"Various Indian airports had long queues and large crowds at IndiGo check-in counters on Saturday after the country’s largest airline’s systems were hit by a network-wide technical glitch early afternoon, which led to slower check-ins and longer waiting times at airports. The glitch, which IndiGo described as a “temporary system slowdown”, also hit the carrier’s website and booking system. In a passenger advisory issued Saturday afternoon, the airline acknowledged the issue and assured passengers that it was working to resolve the problem at the earliest, while informing that increased wait times and longer queues are to be expected till the problem is fully resolved. Later in the evening, IndiGo announced that its airport systems were working normally, although achieving system-wide full normalcy could take some time. “Our airport systems are up and running, and our airport services have eased out effectively. However, we kindly ask for your understanding as we work to restore our other applications. While it may take a little time to achieve full normalcy, we look forward to providing you with a smooth experience soon. Thank you for your understanding and patience,” IndiGo said. The airline, however, did not elaborate on the nature of the technical glitch. The full extent of the impact of the “system slowdown” on IndiGo’s flight operations was also not clear. A few flights at some airports are learnt to have been delayed due to the slower-then-usual check-in operations. From early Saturday afternoon, a number of irate passengers have been posting about excessive crowds at IndiGo’s counters at airports, as well as difficulties in booking flight tickets with the airline. “What’s wrong with the new @IndiGo6E website? Cannot book a simple domestic ticket or pay by credit card. CEOs should be accountable to Board for customer glitches resulting in business losses due to major IT revamps, not the glorified coders posturing as C suite occupants,” economist Rathin Roy wrote in a post on X (formerly Twitter). IndiGo is India’s largest airline with a domestic market share—by passengers ferried—of over 60 per cent, and any major disruption in the airline’s operations can bring India’s entire civil aviation network to its knees. IndiGo, which is also counted among the world’s largest low-cost carriers, operates around 2,100 flights a day to over 85 domestic and 30-plus international destinations.","category":"business"},{"publishedAt":"2024-10-07","title":"Travelling behind the curve: Despite the outbound rush, why India’s foreign tourist arrivals are yet to touch pre-Covid levels","description":"Industry watchers attribute the divergence in trend between foreign tourist arrivals into India and Indians travelling overseas to a combination of reasons, which include subdued tourist footfalls from Bangladesh and China.","urlToImage":"https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/10/travel.jpg?w=640","content":"The post-pandemic surge in international travel is a nearly global phenomenon and the story is not too different when it comes to Indians travelling overseas, with outbound Indian travellers’ numbers having exceeded the pre-Covid levels. The picture, however, is not as exciting when it comes to foreign travellers visiting India. In what continues to be a cause of concern for the country’s tourism industry, foreign tourist arrivals (FTAs) are yet to catch up with the pre-pandemic levels. In the first half of 2024, 47.78 lakh foreign tourists visited India, 9.1 per cent higher on the year, but 9.8 per cent lower than the corresponding period of 2019, which was the last full year before the Covid-19 was declared a global pandemic, per data from the Ministry of Tourism. India has evidently lost some of its sheen even as the world is witnessing a period of the so-called ‘revenge travel’ after the pandemic. In contrast, Indian nationals’ departures from the country in the six months ended June rose 12.3 per cent over the corresponding period of 2019 to 1.50 crore. On a year-on-year basis, the departures were higher by 13.7 per cent. India’s official tourism statistics are released with a lag and June 2024 is the last month for which the data is publicly available. Industry watchers attribute the divergence in trend between foreign tourist arrivals into India and Indians travelling overseas to a combination of reasons, which include subdued tourist footfalls from Bangladesh and China. While Bangladesh, which accounts for the highest number of FTAs into India, has been grappling with a financial crisis that has seemingly impacted travel demand there, absence of direct flights between India and China has evidently dented the number of Chinese nationals travelling to India. Also Read | Indians spend 3.5 times more on foreign travel than they did 5 years ago The other major factor that appears to be at play is other countries in Asia attracting more travellers with easy visa regimes and more value-for-money propositions for tourists. These include some emerging destinations—particularly in Central Asia and Eurasia—that are rapidly growing as international tourism destinations. “Countries such as Qatar, Dubai, Vietnam and Sri Lanka are drawing tourists with more affordable options and favourable visa policies. These destinations have exceeded their pre-Covid levels, with FTAs in Qatar up 47%, Dubai 11%, Vietnam 4% and Sri Lanka 0.2% in the first half of the current calendar,” CRISIL Market Intelligence and Analytics said in a recent note. It added that aggressive campaigns by emerging destinations such as Azerbaijan, Georgia and Kazakhstan are competing for tourist spends. In fact, the number of Indians travelling to such destinations has also shot up significantly in the post-pandemic period. This trend itself lends credence to the argument that the growth being charted by these geographies in terms of international tourist interest has likely hurt foreign tourist arrivals in India. Also Read | Soon, foreign friends of diaspora members to get free visas Besides simple visa rules and easy connectivity, most of these emerging destinations have an added allure: they cost nearly as much or only moderately higher than a holiday at a popular domestic destination. And Indian airlines are taking notice, increasing the number of routes as well as frequency of flights. In July, The Indian Express had reported a surge in the number of Indians travelling to Silk Road countries such as Azerbaijan, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, and Georgia, and Southeast Asia’s latest tourism hotspot, Vietnam. Before the pandemic, these destinations largely attracted more discerning travellers from India. But now, with a combination of enhanced direct flight connectivity, swift and hassle-free visa regimes, and relatively more affordable prices than the conventional touristy destinations, these countries are drawing price-sensitive Indian travellers in droves. Also Read | Surge in ‘Visa at Your Doorstep’ demand among UK travellers to India Passenger traffic on direct flights from India to Azerbaijan in October-March (H2) 2023-24 (FY24) jumped by a whopping 750 per cent on the year, while for Georgia, it shot up by nearly 200 per cent, according to The Indian Express’s analysis of international air traffic data released by the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA). The jump was around 115 per cent in the case of Uzbekistan, 108 per cent for Vietnam, and 70 per cent for Kazakhstan. Meanwhile, India’s total outbound passenger traffic on international flights in H2 of FY24 grew 16.5 per cent on the year, per the DGCA data. “The surge (in the number of Indians travelling overseas) is largely driven by the K-shaped economic recovery, which is playing out in tourism, too. Indians making multiple trips abroad, supported by rising disposable income that has made international travel more affordable and enhanced airline connectivity and streamlined visa processes that have made foreign destinations more accessible,” CRISIL Market Intelligence and Analytics said.","category":"business"},{"publishedAt":"2024-10-07","title":"Market continues to decline on West Asia, FPI outflow concerns","description":"The 30-share Sensex tanked 808.65 points, or 0.98 per cent, to close at 81,688.45.

However, on-year, the cost of home-cooked non-veg thali declined 2 per cent, Crisil said in a report. The veg thali cost rose to Rs 31.3 from Rs 28.1 a year ago due to increase in the prices of vegetables, which collectively account for 37 per cent of the thali cost. Prices of onion, potato and tomato rose 53 per cent, 50 per cent and 18 per cent on-year, respectively, in September because of lower onion and potato arrivals, while heavy rainfall impacted tomato output in Andhra Pradesh and Maharashtra, it said. Price of pulses, which account for 9 per cent of the veg thali cost, rose 14 per cent amid drop in production last year, leading to lower opening stock this year, further contributing to the uptick. “An 11 per cent drop in fuel cost – from Rs 903 for a 14.2 kg LPG cylinder in Delhi in September last year to Rs 803 in March this year – prevented further increase in the thali cost,” Crisil said. For the non-veg thali which was at Rs 59.3, an estimated decline of 13 per cent on-year in broiler prices, which account for 50 per cent of the non-veg thali cost, provided some relief, Crisil said. On-month, the cost of both veg and non-veg thalis remained stable, it said. Onion prices rose 14 per cent on-month because of tight rabi stock in the market as well as reduction of export duty, fuelling trade. However, a 2 per cent decline in potato prices due to stocks released from the cold storage and 9 per cent fall in tomato prices due to higher arrivals from the southern and western markets prevented further increase in the thali cost, Crisil said. For the non-veg thali, stable broiler prices on-month amid steady demand helped maintain the cost. The average cost of preparing a thali at home is calculated based on input prices prevailing in north, south, east and west India. The monthly change reflects the impact on the common man’s expenditure. The data also reveals the ingredients (cereals, pulses, broilers, vegetables, spices, edible oil and cooking gas) driving the change in the cost of the thali. A veg thali comprises roti, vegetables (onion, tomato, and potato), rice, dal, curd, and salad. For non-veg thali, the constituents remain the same but for dal, which is replaced by chicken. India’s retail inflation rate, as measured by the Consumer Price Index (CPI), was 3.65 per cent in August 2024, higher from 3.54 per cent in July 2024.

In its settlement order, Sebi said that NSE, on behalf of itself and other applicants, has remitted the settlement amount of Rs 643 crore on September 25, 2024, the receipt of which is confirmed. Apart from NSE and Limaye, those who settled the case are; Umesh Jain G. M. Shenoy, Narayan Neelakantan, V. R. Narasimhan, Kamala K, Nilesh Tinaikar, R Nandakumar and Mayur Sindhwad. TAP was a software application deployed by NSE in 2008 on the servers of trading members for managing connections and messages (orders/trades) of such members. Trading members, registered with NSE, connected to TAP to establish communication with the NSE trading system. The settlement applications filed by the Applicants, along with revised settlement terms proposed by them, were placed before the High-Powered Advisory Committee (HPAC) during its meeting held on March 18, 2024. The Panel of WTMs accepted the recommendations of the HPAC to settle the matter on composite payment by NSE (for itself and other Applicants) for an amount of Rs 643 crore. Further, the panel of WTMs was of the view that the settlement applications be accepted if, in addition to the aforementioned settlement amount, pro-bono community service of at least 14 days during the current financial year was undertaken by all the applicants, except NSE and G.M. Shenoy as a non-monetary settlement term. Some high-frequency traders allegedly manipulated the TAP platform in 2013 to execute thousands of orders without being detected and crowding out other users. The misuse was detected four years later by the income tax authorities during the investigation of the co-location case involving former NSE CEOs Chitra Ramkrishna and Ravi Narain.

Citing data from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), she said India will be able to increase its per capita income by $2,000 in the next five years. “While it took us 75 years to reach a per capita income of $2,730, as per IMF projections, it will take only five years to add another $2,000. The upcoming decades will see the steepest rise in living standards for the common man, truly making it a period-defining era for an Indian to live in. This is being achieved with declining inequality, as the Gini coefficient for rural India declined from 0.283 to 0.266, and for urban areas it declined from 0.363 to 0.314,” Sitharaman said at the Kautilya Economic Conclave organised by the Ministry of Finance and the Institute of Economic Growth. The Finance Minister said she expects these improvements to continue as the effects of the last ten years of economic and structural reforms are expected to manifest more thoroughly in the data in the coming years as the Covid shock fades from the economy. Referring to India’s economic rise amid ongoing geopolitical conflicts across the world, she said it will be unique in a way since India seeks to double its per capita income in a matter of a few years for its 1.4 billion population, which makes up 18 per cent of the global total, in a fragmented and fractured world where several persistent conflicts may worsen, posing a threat to global peace that is the bedrock of prosperity. While India will continue to grow over the decade, the global backdrop is not the same, she said. “In the early 2000s, emerging markets like China grew relatively more easily due to a favourable global trade and investment climate…India must develop its domestic capacity to develop sustainably,” she said.

Sitharaman underlined twin challenges of dealing with the legacy emissions of the developed world and managing India’s energy transition. The balancing act requires a “whole-of-government” approach and contextualised solutions unique to India, she said. She also raised concerns over the impact on labour from the advent of new technologies, Sitharaman said it may leave a more lasting impact on labour, including workers at all levels, than previous industrial revolutions did. “The resulting economic and social impacts may be more profound than the world has experienced. While this is a global phenomenon, it is more acute for India, given its vast young population and the need to create livelihoods for millions,” she said. She listed demographic dividend, increase in consumption and rising middle class, innovation ability and well-capitalised financial system as the factors that will shape India’s growth era moving forward. While India’s share of the young is set to rise over the next two decades even as several other developing economies are past their demographic peak, Sitharaman said India’s core policy priority would be to ensure that the youth are cognitively equipped, emotionally strong and physically fit. There will be “organic growth in consumption” since as of now, 43 per cent of Indians are younger than 24 years old, and they have yet to explore their consumption behaviour fully, she said. “There will be organic growth in consumption as they become full-fledged consumers. Simultaneously, a rising middle class will pave the way for strong consumption, inflow of foreign investment and a vibrant marketplace,” she said. Also Read | We’ve achieved a lot since 1947.

On the government finances front, Sitharaman said the government will continue to uphold its commitment to reducing the fiscal deficit. “Aided by buoyant revenue generation, restrained revenue expenditure growth and healthy economic activity, the fiscal deficit is estimated to decline further from 5.6 per cent of GDP in FY24 (provisional actuals) to 4.9 per cent in FY25. The commitment to fiscal discipline will not only help keep bond yields in check but will translate to lower economy-wide borrowing costs,” she said. She said a larger proportion of fiscal deficit is not accounted for by capital outlays indicating an increasingly investment-oriented deficit financing.

Be it the World Bank, IMF, or Moody’s, everyone upgraded India-related forecasts. All these institutions are saying that despite global uncertainties, India will grow at more than 7 per cent. We have confidence that we will do even better,” PM Modi said during his address at the third edition of the Kautilya Economic Conclave. “The Indian economy is going through big transformational changes – with strong economic fundamentals, the economy is on course towards sustained high growth. India is not just preparing to reach the top, but is also working hard to remain on top,” he added. The PM said that the Indian economy remained resilient despite war-like situations in two regions which are crucial for the global economy and energy security. “India is the world’s fastest growing major economy. As per GDP, it’s the fifth largest economy. It is number one in global fintech adoption rate, number one in data consumption, and number two in terms of Internet users,” he said. “Half of the world’s real time digital transactions happen in India. We are the third largest startup ecosystem in the world. We are fourth in terms of renewable energy capacity, number two in terms of mobile manufacturing, and number one in producing two-wheelers and tractors. India is the world’s youngest country. It has the third largest pool of scientists and technicians; be it science, technology or innovation, India is clearly in a sweet spot,” he added. Highlighting steps that have been taken in the first three months since the formation of the new government, the PM said that they have focused on “bold policy changes, jobs and skills”. The PM also said that the government was focusing on reducing inequality. “One notable factor of India’s growth story has been its inclusive spirit. Earlier, it used to happen that there was some growth, but inequality increased. Today, the opposite is happening – we have growth along with inclusion. In the last 10 years, 250 million people have come out of extreme poverty. Through India’s fast growth, we are ensuring that inequality goes down, and everyone benefits from development,” he said. “Be it manufacturing or the services sector, India is a favourable place for investors. This is no coincidence, but a result of the big reforms of the last 10 years,” Modi added. Talking about the Prime Minister’s Internship scheme that aims to provide internship to one crore youth in top 500 companies over five years, Modi said that 111 companies have already registered on the portal. The PM also highlighted the focus on manufacturing. “To give impetus to manufacturing, we brought the PLI scheme, and the impact is visible in several sectors. In the last three years alone, Rs 1.25 lakh crore worth of investments have come in, with production of worth Rs 11 trillion happening in India,” he said. “In space and defence, India’s growth has been fantastic. In the space sector, there are more than 200 startups. Nearly 20 per cent of the total defence manufacturing is being done by private companies,” he added. “India is also the biggest source of affordable intellectual property. Over 2 million Indians are providing the world highly skilled services through more than 1,700 global capability centres in the country,” he said. “India is also focusing on AI and semiconductors and are investing a lot in these sectors. Through our AI Missi0n, research and skills will increase. Under the India Semiconductor Mission, investments worth Rs 1.5 lakh crore have happened. Soon, five semiconductor plants in India will send made in india chips across the world,” PM Modi added.","category":"business"},{"publishedAt":"2024-10-07","title":"Foreign exchange reserves touch a record high of $704.88 billion","description":"RBI has been building forex reserves to create a buffer against any global spillovers.","urlToImage":"https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/10/foreign-exchange-2-1_20241004154555.jpg?w=640","content":"Country’s foreign exchange reserves surged by $12.59 billion to hit an all-time high of $704.885 billion in the week ended September 27, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) data showed.

In the reporting week, the foreign currency assets (FCA), a large component of the overall reserves, gained by $10.46 billion to $616.154 billion, the RBI’s weekly data showed. FCA are maintained as a multi-currency portfolio comprising major currencies, such as, US dollar, Euro, Pound sterling, Japanese yen, and are valued in terms of US dollars. Gold reserves also rose by $2.184 billion to $65.796 billion. RBI has been building forex reserves to create a buffer against any global spillovers. “The biggest source of strength for this reserve build-up is the balance of payments surplus.

BofA Securities’ Bajoria sees foreign reserves growing to $707 billion by March 2025 and $745 billion by March 2026, with prospects of a larger war chest in the near term given falling crude oil prices and a rise in both equity and debt-related inflows.","category":"business"},{"publishedAt":"2024-10-07","title":"EU countries vote to impose duties on China EVs ahead of an end-of-October deadline","description":"The European Commission, which manages trade on behalf of the 27 member countries, welcomed their majority approval of its plan to impose the duties, even though EU automotive powerhouse Germany and Hungary voted against it.","urlToImage":"https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/07/Untitled-design-78.jpg?w=640","content":"European Union countries on Friday voted to impose duties on imports of electric vehicles from China, as talks continued between Brussels and Beijing to find an amicable solution to their trade dispute before an end-of-October deadline. Electric vehicles have become a major flash point in a broader trade dispute over the influence of Chinese government subsidies on European markets — which has forced the undercutting of EU industry prices — and Beijing’s burgeoning exports of green technology to the bloc. The European Commission, which manages trade on behalf of the 27 member countries, welcomed their majority approval of its plan to impose the duties, even though EU automotive powerhouse Germany and Hungary voted against it. Those duties will come into force on Oct. 31 unless China has a solution to end the standoff. Commission spokesman Olof Gill said that any solution proposed by Beijing would have to be fully compatible with World Trade Organization rules, remedy “the injurious subsidization” by China, and be “monitorable and enforceable.” Beijing opposes the duties. “China firmly opposes the EU’s unfair, non-compliant and unreasonable protectionist practices in this case, and firmly opposes the EU’s imposition of anti-subsidy duties on Chinese electric vehicles,” a spokesperson at China’s Commerce Ministry said in comments posted online. Still, it means that the EU and the Chinese government have four more weeks to negotiate. Talks have already been held between Valdis Dombrovskis, the EU commissioner for the economy, and Chinese Trade Minister Wang Wentao, as well as at the level of technical experts. The China-EU technical teams are due to resume negotiations on Oct. 7. The duties on Chinese manufacturers, if applied, would be 17% on cars from BYD, 18.8% on those from Geely and 35.3% for vehicles exported by China’s state-owned SAIC. Geely has brands including Polestar and Sweden’s Volvo, while SAIC owns Britain’s MG, one of Europe’s bestselling EV brands. Other EV manufacturers in China including Western companies such as Volkswagen and BMW would be subject to duties of 20.7%. The commission has an “individually calculated” rate for Tesla of 7.8%. The retaliatory duties have run into opposition in Germany, which has Europe’s biggest economy and is home to major automakers. Germany’s auto industry association, the VDA, said the German government sent the “right signal” by voting against them. Hildegard Müller, who chairs the group, called the decision “a further step away from global cooperation.” She acknowledged that there is a need for negotiations with China and said that they “must prevent an escalation – ideally avert the tariffs, so that we don’t risk a trade conflict.” Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán warned that the EU risks starting an “economic cold war” with China, and he pledged to vote against the duties. “This is the worst thing that can happen to Europe. … If this continues, the European economy will die,” he told state radio. According to the commission, Chinese-built electric cars jumped from 3.9% of the EV market in 2020 to 25% by September 2023, in part by unfairly undercutting EU industry prices. Brussels says companies in China accomplished that with the help of subsidies across the production chain. They ran from cheap land for factories from local governments to below-market supplies of lithium and batteries from state-owned enterprises to tax breaks and easy financing from state-controlled banks.

The new flight paths, which are longer than the ones that went through the Iranian airspace, are bound to translate into higher fuel burn—and consequently higher operating costs—for airlines. As a result, industry watchers feel that international airfares could rise further, if the West Asian conflict rages on. For the analysis, the paths taken by flights operated on October 3 were compared with those of the same flights operated 10 days earlier—September 23. Tensions in West Asia have been escalating rapidly over the past couple of weeks. The most recent development—Iran’s large-scale missile attack on Israel on October 2—marked the latest flashpoint in the ongoing regional conflict. To be sure, the initial airspace restrictions that were imposed by various countries in the region following Tuesday’s missile attack were lifted soon after. Most global airlines, however, are evidently still loath to use the airspace. Latest flight tracking data shows that while some airlines—mainly Middle-Eastern carriers—have started using the Iranian airspace again, most are still trying to avoid it. All Europe and UK-bound flights of Air India and Vistara are now flying over Central Asian countries like Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, and Turkmenistan, while avoiding the Iranian airspace altogether, shows flight path data from Flightradar24. Earlier, a large number of these flights were transiting the Iranian airspace on their way to Europe and the UK, and only a few—Air India’s Delhi-London Heathrow flights being a case in point—were taking a path that did not overfly Iran at all. Here is the comparison of flight paths taken by two Europe-bound flights—one each of Air India and Vistara—on October 3 and September 23. Air India flight AI 137 (Delhi-Milan) Vistara UK 21 (Delhi-Paris) Although IndiGo does not operate any flights to Europe or the UK, the carrier’s flights to Istanbul in Turkey have been impacted. Instead of flying over Iran, IndiGo’s Delhi-Istanbul flight is now forced to take a longer and circuitous route over Central Asia, the Caspian Sea, and the Caucasus region, before entering the Turkish airspace. Indigo flight 6E 11 (Delhi-Istanbul) In the September 23 flight path for this flight—6E 11—the aircraft followed a straightforward route—entering Pakistani airspace, followed by Iranian airspace, before entering Turkey.","category":"business"},{"publishedAt":"2024-10-07","title":"Record-Breaking Start: The Amazon Great Indian Festival 2024 witnessed a record 11 crore customer visits in the first 48 hours, with 80% coming from Tier 2 and smaller towns","description":"Over 200,000 customers purchased a mobile phone for the first time, reflecting growing confidence in investing in quality technology.","urlToImage":"https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/10/Amazon_LEAD_74c0fd.jpg?w=640","content":"Amazon India’s biggest shopping event is now live.

This follows a series of unexpected curbs imposed by China, including restrictions on exports of gallium and germanium—products widely used in the semiconductor industry—and a ban on exporting technology for manufacturing rare earth magnets, as well as technology to extract and separate critical materials. India’s Minister of Commerce and Industry, Piyush Goyal, and US Secretary of Commerce, Gina Raimondo, signed a new memorandum of understanding (MoU) Thursday to expand and diversify critical mineral supply chains. The aim is to leverage the two countries’ complementary strengths to enhance resilience in the critical minerals sector, according to an official statement. “Priority areas of focus include identifying equipment, services, policies, and best practices to facilitate the mutually beneficial commercial development of US and Indian critical minerals, including exploration, extraction, processing and refining, recycling, and recovery,” a statement from the US Department of Commerce said. Speaking about the MoU at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, Commerce Minister Goyal described the partnership as multi-dimensional, encompassing open supply chains for materials, technology development, and investment flows to promote green energy. Goyal further emphasised the need for India and the US to include other nations in the partnership, especially mineral-rich countries in Africa and South America. “We will continue to expand cooperation in new areas and strengthen existing ones by capitalising on the immense opportunities for India-US trade and commercial partnership,” the minister said in a social media post. The agreement follows a recommendation from the US last month that India should “expand and protect” its clean energy manufacturing. India’s Production Linked Incentive (PLI) schemes have invested over $4.5 billion to catalyse nascent clean energy manufacturing; however, “additional policies are essential” to safeguard these investments against “global market dynamics” and “thin profit margins,” according to a joint India-US statement. The Economic Survey 2023-24 also noted that China’s manufacturing trade surplus has been expanding since 2019 due to weak domestic demand and increasing industrial capacity. The mismatch between domestic supply and demand in China has widened in recent years, prompting Chinese companies to seek additional markets overseas. Citing coercive actions taken by China to restrict India’s access to solar equipment, the survey stated: “…in response to India’s anti-dumping probe against Chinese entities, China has been quietly blocking India’s access to solar equipment.” To protect domestic solar photovoltaic (PV) module manufacturing, including projects under the PLI scheme, the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE) reinstated the Approved List of Models and Manufacturers (ALMM) order on April 1. This order prevents domestic solar projects from using imported modules, primarily from China, which are sold at significantly lower prices. In June 2024, imported modules were priced at an average of 9.1 cents per watt (CIF basis), while domestic modules averaged 18 cents per watt, according to CRISIL. Earlier last month, the ministry announced plans to extend the ALMM order to solar cells from April 2026. The PLI scheme for high-efficiency PV modules, with a total budgetary outlay of Rs 24,000 crore across two tranches, also incentivises solar cell production.","category":"business"},{"publishedAt":"2024-10-07","title":"Household ownership of equity surges to 21.5%","description":"India’s equity market capitalization jumped more than 50 per cent year-on-year to Rs 441 lakh crore as of the quarter ended June 2024.","urlToImage":"https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/10/money.jpg?w=640","content":"INDIAN households are not as conservative in their financial investments as many believe. The household sector, which includes individuals and non-profit institutions serving households directly, owned 21.5 per cent of India’s listed equity market as of June 2024, much higher when compared to other developed markets, excluding the US, according to a research report. This ownership has remained within a very narrow range of 21-22 per cent since the beginning of the calendar year 2021, following a more stable period of almost five years when it was between 18 per cent and 20 per cent prior to that, and between 16 per cent and 17 per cent during 2011 to mid-2016, the report prepared by Motilal Oswal Financial Services said. “If we combine the direct and indirect exposure (mutual fund investments) of the household sector, referred to as equity & investment funds (E&IFs), it amounted to Rs 134 lakh crore (US $ 1.6 trillion) or 44 per cent of GDP in the first quarter of FY25,” the report said. India’s equity market capitalization jumped more than 50 per cent year-on-year to Rs 441 lakh crore as of the quarter ended June 2024, while the holdings of the household sector surged to 95 lakh crore during the period from Rs 60 lakh crore (or 20.6 per cent of the equity market) in the same period last year, says the report. The E&IF figure is again comparable to the 30-55 per cent range observed in most advanced economies covered in the study. However, it is less than half of 100 per cent of GDP in Canada and 161 per cent of GDP in the US. Further, the share of E&IFs increased to 28 per cent of GFAs of households in India in 1QFY25, compared to 17 per cent at the end of CY19, the Motilal report said. Notwithstanding the stable share of the household sector in listed equities, which has experienced occasional step-ups, the impressive surge in equity market capitalization over the past year has propelled the market value of household gross financial assets (HHGFA). Barring the US, the household sector owns between 11 per cent and 18 per cent of the listed equity market in other major economies, which is lower than 21-22 per cent share in India, Motilal report said. The share, notably, is much higher at 40 per cent in the US though. Further, the share of the household sector in the listed equity market has increased in the post-pandemic period in India, Germany (DE), and the US, while it has declined only in Canada (CA), with a largely stable share in other economies. Direct exposure to listed equities, however, constitutes only a portion of the total exposure of the household sector. “Mutual funds (MFs, or investment funds) also play a very important role, and thus, we combined both direct and indirect exposure (through MFs) to determine the total exposure of the household sector to the securities market,” it said. With investors pumping into equity schemes of mutual funds, the total size (or the asset under management, AUM) of India’s mutual fund industry reached Rs 61.2 lakh crore as of June 2024, up 38 per cent from a year ago. The household sector (including high net worth individuals and retail) owned about 63 per cent of the MFs AUM, up from 55 per cent in December 2019 and 50 per cent in 2014-15, the report said. Within this, equity instruments accounted for about 70 per cent, while non-equity constituted the remaining 30 per cent (almost the same as in December 2019 but much lower than 50 per cent a decade ago), the report said. The RBI recently released its first-ever quarterly estimates of the household financial balance sheet from 1QFY12 to 4QFY23. “We replicated the RBI’s methodology and achieved 96-97 per cent accuracy in our result,” the report said. “We extended these estimates to Q1 of FY25 based on some assumptions. One of the key developments has been the rising prominence of the equity market in household gross financial assets during the past few years, particularly since the onset of the pandemic,” it said. Overall, there is no doubt that the role of the equity market in household financial balance sheets and financial net worth has increased significantly in the post-pandemic period, particularly over the past 4-5 quarters. This trend may contribute to the growing wealth effect within the household sector. However, the declining level of household savings (flow, annual data) and the usual concentration of financial wealth among a specific group (the top of the pyramid) suggest that further research and more granular data are necessary. “Further, one must think twice before calling the Indian household sector conservative in terms of its exposure to the equity markets,” it said.","category":"business"},{"publishedAt":"2024-10-07","title":"As internship pilot gets underway, M&M, Alembic & Max Life kick-off scheme by listing positions for interns","description":"Selected interns will be paid Rs 4,500 per month as stipend by the government through Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT).","urlToImage":"https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/10/Internship_20f80c.jpg?w=640","content":"The Prime Minister’s Internship scheme that aims to provide internship to one crore youth in top 500 companies over five years opened its portal for companies to register their internship opportunities for the pilot phase from Thursday (October 3). A total of 111 companies have come on board, with a total of 1,077 internship positions already listed by three companies — Mahindra & Mahindra, Alembic Pharma, and Max Life Insurance. The internship positions have been listed for four states as of Thursday — Maharashtra, Uttarakhand, Telangana and Gujarat across auto, pharma and agriculture and allied sectors. Eligible candidates will be able to log into the portal http://www.pminternship.mca.gov.in to register for the internship positions from October 12 onwards. The first pilot phase of the scheme, which will run through several layers of matching profiles, selection of candidates and offer letters, aims to provide internship opportunities to 1.25 lakh candidates involving a cost of Rs 800 crore for the government. Around 1 lakh youth are expected to be enrolled in the internship scheme by early December. Youth aged between 21-24 years who are not employed full-time and not studying full-time will be eligible to apply. Candidates who have passed high school, higher secondary school, have a certificate from an ITI, hold a diploma from a polytechnic institute, or are graduates with degrees such as B.A., B. Sc., B. Com, BCA, BBA, B.Pharma are eligible to apply under the scheme. Reservation structure will be the same as government jobs for SCs, STs, OBCs and disabled in the internship scheme.

Graduates from IITs, IIMs, national law universities, IISER, NIDs and IIITs or those having qualifications such as CA, CMA, CS, MBBS, BDS, MBA, any master’s or higher degree will also be ineligible. “The portal has been made available to the companies for them to enter their internship opportunities till October 12. On the morning of October 12, the portal will be opened for the youth to come on board. They can then register themselves based on their educational qualification, location till October 25,” a government source said. Candidates will be matched with their eligibility, educational qualification and the company’s internship position through a selection process involving artificial intelligence by the government agency BISAG-N (Bhaskaracharya National Institute for Space Applications and Geo-informatics). They will also be matched with their pincode and the nearest available internship opportunity so that the candidate does not have to travel outside his or her state. “The idea is to look for opportunities near their location. They may move between districts but not outside their state. Some companies have also offered to take care of the cost of travel and food for the candidates,” the source said. No other benefit would be given to the interns as legally they won’t be eligible for any worker benefits. However, the government will provide insurance coverage to each intern under the schemes of Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana and Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana for which premium amount would be paid by the government.

Candidates will have time to accept the offer between November 8 to November 15. In case the candidate does not accept the first internship offer, two more offers would be made, the source said. Internship will then commence from December 2 onwards for a period of one year. This pilot phase is expected to be expanded to include more candidates on an ongoing basis and as the government takes a Cabinet approval for spending and design of the final structure of the scheme, sources said. Call centres have been made operational in several languages including Odia, Gujarati, Assamese, Marathi, Kannada, Bengali and Telugu. Among the queries received on the helpline so far, 44 per cent candidates are graduates, 11 per cent are 12th pass, 3 per cent are with or without additional diploma, 3 per cent are 10th pass, 1 per cent are 8th pass and rest belong to the miscellaneous category. A multilingual tele helpline, 1800-116-090, has been set up to provide assistance and facilitation to the stakeholders in different languages. Over 900 candidates who have made the queries regarding the internship scheme were from ITIs, 59 were diploma holders and 17 have B. Pharma degree, sources said. Selected interns will be paid Rs 4,500 per month as stipend by the government through Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT). An additional Rs 500 per month will be provided by the company’s CSR (corporate social responsibility) funds. The government will also provide a one-time grant of Rs 6,000 per annum for incidentals to cover miscellaneous expenses incurred by the selected candidate during the internship. The internship scheme was announced in the Budget for 2024-25 as part of the Prime Minister’s Package for Employment and Skilling with an overall outlay of Rs 2 lakh crore. It aims to provide skill training to over one crore youth in India’s top 500 companies in five years, with a focus on those with lower employability. For the current financial year 2024-25, the government allocated Rs 2,000 crore to the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA), which is tasked to oversee the scheme’s implementation. “The idea is to provide interns with an opportunity to experience real-time business environments to equip them with practical experience that enhances their employability,” the source cited above said. Companies have been asked to partner with their supply chain companies, sister concerns and even distributors, dealers, among others to distribute the internship opportunities. Partner companies will have a dashboard on the portal where they can post internship opportunities. Eligible candidates will register on the portal where their details will be used to generate a CV. Candidates will be able to browse internships based on their preferred sectors, roles and locations and apply for up to five positions. Upon completion of the internship, the company will be required to upload a certification of completion on the portal which will have the details of the key competencies acquired by the intern. If an intern leaves the program midway through the internship, the candidate will be counted as an intern but will not get a certificate.","category":"business"},{"publishedAt":"2024-10-07","title":"Currencies, stocks fall on Mideast caution; Hong Kong shares ease","description":"On the geopolitical front, Israel bombed Beirut and killed at least six people after its forces suffered their deadliest day on the Lebanese front in a year of clashes with Iran-backed Hezbollah.","urlToImage":"https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/10/Untitled-design-2024-10-03T161040.856.jpg?w=640","content":"Most emerging market assets dropped on Thursday as investors vigilant of Middle East tensions favoured safe-haven assets while awaiting further clues on the health of the U.S. economy, with Hong Kong shares easing after a blistering rally.

Shahana (26), a postgraduate student in the surgery department of the Government Medical College here, was found unconscious at her apartment and later declared brought dead at the hospital on Tuesday. Shahana allegedly took the extreme step as she was depressed due to a big dowry sought by the groom’s family, her family alleged. Based on their statements, Ruwais, her friend who is also a post graduate doctor in the College, was taken into custody from Karunagappally early today, police said. “We have taken him into custody based on the statements of the victim’s family. He is being interrogated,” a senior officer told PTI. He said a case of unnatural death was registered soon after the woman doctor’s death. Sections of abetment to suicide and Dowry Prohibition Act were added based on the statements of Dr Shahana’s family, he added. “We have to check the veracity of various statements we have recorded. Further proceedings including his arrest will be decided only after that,” the officer said. On Wednesday, the government had ordered a probe into the death of Shahana after allegations of dowry related issues causing the suicide cropped up. Health Minister Veena George directed the director of the Women and Child Development Department to carry out a probe and submit a report regarding this. The state Minority Commission also intervened into the issue and initiated a case on its own based on media reports in this regard. Its Chairperson A A Rasheed directed the district collector, city police commissioner and director of medical education to appear before the Commission during its next sitting here on December 14 and submit a report on the incident. State Women’s Commission Chairperson P Sathidevi visited Shahana’s residence in nearby Venjaramoodu and consoled her mother on Wednesday. The victim’s father, who was working in the Middle East, died recently. Expressing grief and concern over the alleged suicide of the young doctor, Sathidevi said stringent measures should be taken if the mental agony caused due to dowry had forced her to take the extreme step. People close to the deceased’s family had alleged that Shahana was depressed as her friend had backed out of their marriage citing dowry as the reason.","category":"kerala"},{"publishedAt":"2024-10-07","title":"Kerala Muslim leader says CPM leaders promoting interfaith marriages involving Muslim girls","description":"Nasar Faizy Koodathai, secretary of the Sunni Yuvajana Sangham, warns the community about the ruling party’s 'tactics with the label of secularism’.","urlToImage":"https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/12/Nasar-Faizy-Koodathai.jpg?w=640","content":"A prominent Muslim leader in Kerala has accused the ruling CPM of promoting interfaith marriages in such a way that Muslim girls are “being abducted and married off to non-Muslims” with the backing of the party and its youth and student wings. While addressing a meeting in Kozhikode, Nasar Faizy Koodathai, secretary of the Sunni Yuvajana Sangham, the youth wing of the influential Samastha Kerala Jem-iyyathul Ulama, said the community should remain vigilant about the CPM’s “tactics with the label of secularism”. Koodathai said that for certain people, secularism means a Hindu marrying a Muslim. “Recently we have seen unscrupulous political strategies to promote interfaith marriages. The Constitution permits that a Muslims should marry a Muslim and Hindu should marry Hindu. But certain people have a crooked view that Bhartiya culture can be promoted only when a Hindu marries a Muslim. Muslim girls are being abducted with the backing of the party’s offices, newspaper offices, leaders of the CPM, DYFI and the SFI, and they are being married off to non-Muslims. Mahallu (masjid) committees should stand united against such rejection of religion,’’ he said. This is the first time a leader associated with the influential body of Sunni Muslim clerics has publicly spoken against interfaith marriage in a state where Hindu and Christian outfits have accused Muslims of engaging in “love jihad’’. The Samastha Kerala Jem-iyyathul Ulama, or Samastha, is close to the Indian Union Muslim League, an ally of the Congress in Kerala. However, the CPM has recently been wooing Muslims through the organisation and its leaders have shared stages with the clerics on many issues. The government was accused of withdrawing plans to introduce gender-neutral uniforms in schools following protests, mainly from Samastha, which was of the view that such uniforms would encourage homosexuality.","category":"kerala"},{"publishedAt":"2024-10-07","title":"Renowned economist and Dalit thinker M Kunjaman found dead at home","description":"A native of Vadanamkurissi in Palakkad, Kunjaman was born to the Dalit community of Panan.","urlToImage":"https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/12/kunjaman.jpg?w=640","content":"Renowned economist, academician and prominent Dalit thinker M Kunjaman, 74, was found dead at his residence here on Sunday evening. He served as an Economics faculty at the University of Kerala, member of the University Grants Commission and professor at the Tuljapur campus of Tata Institute of Social Science (TISS). Kunjaman’s life is a remarkable journey of a Dalit amid caste oppression and poverty in the initial period of post-independent India to a well-known academician. Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan, in his condolence, said, “Kunjaman has been an economist who had his own perspective towards the development of Kerala. His autobiography, Ethiru, was a true reflection of the realities of life. His death is a big loss to Kerala.” A native of Vadanamkurissi in Palakkad, Kunjaman was born to the Dalit community of Panan. His parents were farm workers. He lived in abject poverty. Oppression remained a shadow throughout his journey. Recalling his childhood days, Kunjaman had once narrated how he had to grapple with dogs for daily meals. He grew up eating the leftovers of the rich landlords. Kunjaman struggled all his way to higher education while elementary education was rare for peers in his community. In 1974, he won the first rank in MA in Economics. He then became the second Dalit after late president K R Narayanan to bag first rank in post-graduation. But poverty continued to haunt the Dalit rank holder. He was forced to sell the gold medal, day after it was conferred to him, to buy provisions for his home. After MA in Economics, he joined MPhil at the Centre for Development Studies (CDS) in Thiruvananthapuram and later went on to obtain doctorate in Economics from Cochin University of Science and Technology. Even then, Kunjaman was initially denied the job of a teacher despite emerging as the top scorer in the merit list under the general quota. He was denied a job for being a Dalit. But well-wishers identified the brilliant academician in the Dalit youth, who began his career with the University of Kerala in 1979. He served as a faculty at the Economics Department for 27 years. For a brief period, he had been a member of the UGC. In 2006, he quit the University of Kerala and joined as a Professor of Economics at TISS. In 2021, his autobiography ‘Ethiru’ had been selected as the best autobiography by the Kerala Sahitya Academy. But Kunjaman refused to accept the honour. In his autobiography, Kunjaman had depicted the Dalit life in Kerala. He had authored several studies on land reforms, reservation and the Dalit crisis. His major works include ‘Development of Tribal Economy, State Level Planning In India, Globalization: A Subaltern Perspective, Economic Development and Social changing’. Kunjaman had been considered for several posts in the academic and planning arenas of Kerala but caste had apparently remained a major barrier.","category":"kerala"},{"publishedAt":"2024-10-07","title":"Kidnapping that gripped Kerala ends in arrest of couple and their YouTuber daughter","description":"The girl was abducted on Monday from Oyoor town and was found abandoned, but safe, at a ground in Kollam city the next day.","urlToImage":"https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/12/Kerala-police.jpg?w=640","content":"The abduction of a six-year-old girl in Kerala’s Kollam district – a case that has gripped the state this week – culminated with the arrest of a popular YouTuber and her parents on Saturday. The girl was abducted on Monday from Oyoor town and was found abandoned, but safe, at a ground in Kollam city the next day. Since then, police have been on the hunt for the kidnappers. On Friday, police traced the three accused – businessman K R Padmakumar (52), his wife Anitha Kumar (45), and their daughter, YouTuber and social media influencer P Anupama (20) – to Tenkasi in Tamil Nadu. The three were residents of Chathannoor in Kollam. Their arrest was registered on Saturday. It was a ransom call made by Anitha, demanding Rs 10 lakh from the girl’s family, that eventually led police to the accused, after a local resident recognised her voice. Additional Director General of Police (Law and Order) M R Ajith Kumar said the family was desperate for money because of the debt racked up by Premkumar. Padmakumar, an engineering graduate, ran a local cable TV service and also did farming, but faced a severe financial crisis during the pandemic, the ADGP said. He had purportedly borrowed money to the tune of around Rs 5 crore, and needed Rs 10 lakh immediately to tide things over with his creditors. “The abduction was originally planned a year back… They then revived the plan one-and-a-half months ago. They were looking for targets in a remote area, away from public attention,” the ADGP said. According to him, the accused had zeroed in on the six-year-old girl days before her abduction. Padmakumar’s daughter, Anupama, is popular on YouTube and other social media, and had been earning between Rs 3 lakh and Rs 5 lakh a month until recently before her content was demonetised, ADGP Kumar said. The reason for the demonetisation was not made clear. When her payments stopped coming through, “the daughter, who initially objected to the crime, also stood with her parents’ plan,” Kumar said. On the precautions taken by the accused ahead of the abduction, the ADGP said: “The car that the family used to abduct the girl had a fake number plate, which they had prepared last year. A second fake number plate was made recently.” According to police, they would take the car out regularly to look for a child to abduct. They would change number plates mid-journey, and were careful not to use mobile phones to communicate about this matter, police said. Last week, they spotted the six-year-old and her older brother walking down the road on their way to tuition classes, and identified her as a target. According to police, they would then repeatedly survey the area, and twice tried to abduct her before pulling out at the last moment because others were around. Finally on Monday, they found the siblings alone and managed to drag the six-year-old into their car before driving away, police said. They initially covered her mouth, and then got her to calm down by saying they were taking her to her father. The next step for the abductors was to seek ransom from the girl’s family, the ADGP said. Leaving the girl at home in Chathannoor with their daughter, the couple went to Kollam’s Parippally, after which Anitha took an auto to go to a shop. After making some purchases from there, she made a call to the girl’s mother from the shop owner’s phone and demanded Rs 10 lakh ransom. She had earlier taken the mother’s number from the girl, police said. Later, when TV channels got hold of the recorded call and started telecasting it, a local resident suspected that it was a voice that he knew. After he shared his suspicion with police, it led investigators to turn their attention to Anitha. Subsequent analysis of call details helped police find more evidence to suspect Anitha. On Monday, after the couple got back to their house, they realised that the abduction had become sensational news. They also realised that police were actively searching for the girl. This put them in a panic and they decided to abandon the plan. At around 11 am on Tuesday, they took the girl to Kollam city. After parking the car, Anitha Kumari took the girl in an auto to a ground in the city where she managed to drop her off without being noticed. Police, who had launched a massive search for the girl, soon located her at the ground and reunited her with her parents. Meanwhile, the three accused decided to leave Kollam, and headed to Tenkasi in Tamil Nadu where a family friend had a farm. However, police had already identified Anitha as the woman behind the ransom call, and found she had left the state with her husband and daughter. After tracking them for a couple of days, they were located and taken into custody in Tenkasi. The three accused were charged with abduction, wrongful confinement and conspiracy. They were produced before a magistrate court, which remanded them in judicial custody for two weeks.","category":"kerala"},{"publishedAt":"2024-10-07","title":"Kerala Guv Khan blames CM Vijayan for pressuring him to reappoint Kannur VC","description":"Khan, speaking to reporters here, said that state Higher Education Minister R Bindu was not to be blamed as the CM used her for seeking reappointment of Ravindran.","urlToImage":"https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/11/Arif-Khan-Pinarayi-Vijayan-1.jpg?w=640","content":"Kerala Governor Arif Mohammed Khan on Thursday accused Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan of pressuring him to reappoint Gopinath Ravindran as the vice chancellor (VC) of Kannur University.

Last week, the Supreme Court had asked the office of the Governor to go through its verdict in a similar case filed by the Punjab government, in which the top court held that Governors could not “thwart the normal course of lawmaking”. On Tuesday, the Governor cleared the Kerala Public Health Bill. The Bills sent for presidential assent are two University Amendment 2021 Bills, the Kerala Lokayukta Bill, two University Laws (Amendment) Bills, a Bill regarding the expansion of the University Search Committee, and the Kerala Cooperative Societies (Amendment) Bill. A three-judge Bench, led by Chief Justice of India D Y Chandrachud has been hearing the Kerala government’s plea against Governor Khan regarding the pending Bills.

The stampede took place after it started to rain minutes before a musical event was set to take place at the institute as part of its annual ‘Dhishna’ tech festival. When the rain began, the crowd waiting outside the lone entry gate reportedly rushed inside the covered amphitheatre, causing people to fall down on steep steps and get trampled. Other than the four deaths, 64 people were injured in the incident. Of the injured, 34 are still in hospital, with two of them on life support. Tearful farewell On Sunday, CUSAT bid a tearful farewell to the three students, whose bodies were laid at the campus for public homage. People’s representatives, CUSAT faculty members and hundreds of students lined past the bodies of the students. Later, the families took the bodies home. Engineering student Ann Riftha, 21, a native of Chendamangalam in Ernakulam district, was among those who died on Saturday. She was an upcoming performer of Chavittu Nadakam, a traditional musical dance drama art form popular among the Latin Catholic community in the coastal region of Kerala. She belonged to a family of Chavittu Nadakam artistes, with her father, Roy Georgekutty, a trainer in the art form. “The family was passionate about Chavittu Nadakam. Ann had started performing from childhood, and in her first performance, she played an angel,” family friend Shaiby Thomas said. Ann’s father also worked as a mason, and her mother, Sindhu, has been working as a home nurse in Italy for the last one year. Rithul, Ann’s brother, was studying hotel management. “The mother went to Italy to make money for her daughter’s education. She came to know about the incident through the news, but had not initially realised Ann was also a victim. She is expected to reach Kochi on Tuesday, and the funeral will be held after that,” Shaiby said. Another victim of the stampede was Athul Thambi, 24, from Koothattukulam in Ernakulam. He was the son of farm labourer Kochuparayil Thambi. Described as a brilliant student, Athul had previously been forced to abandon his studies due to the family’s financial crisis. He then got training from a polytechnic and started working as a supervisor. Later, he was able to quit his job and join CUSAT to study engineering. “Every weekend, he used to come home. But yesterday (Saturday), he informed his mother, Lilly, in the evening that he would be staying back at CUSAT campus this weekend,” said Koothattukulam municipal councillor Sunny Kuriakose. He has an elder brother Ajin, who is an engineer, Kuriakose said. At Thamarassery in Kozhikode, the Thuvakkunnil family was mourning the death of Sara Thomas, 20, another engineering student. Her father, Scaria Thomas, had been bitten by a snake a few months ago and had a long battle for his life, from which he only recently emerged. “Sara, a brilliant student, had got admission at other engineering colleges in Kerala. But the profile of CUSAT as a prestigious institution, and the fact that one of her relatives worked at the university, made the family choose that institute. Scaria Thomas is yet to recover fully from the health problems related to the snake bite. For several months since the snake bite last December, he fought for his life at hospital and later at home,’’ said their neighbour and CPI(M) worker Shamsudheen. Thomas, who had worked in the Gulf, had returned home a few years ago and was living with his family in a rented house. His wife, Kochurani, is a homemaker. They have two other daughters – the eldest is married and the youngest is a higher secondary student. The fourth victim of the tragedy, 23-year-old Alwin Joseph, was not a student. He was an electrician from Mundur in Palakkad, and had been staying in Kochi while looking for job opportunities. His father, Joseph, is a farm worker. Alwin’s plan was to eventually find a job and settle abroad. On Saturday, Alwin is thought to have gone to CUSAT for the music show. When his father saw the news of the stampede on TV, he called Alwin’s phone, but got no answer, said Mundur panchayat member K T Sabjalatha. “Later in the night, when they repeatedly called, someone picked up saying that they got the handset abandoned at the CUSAT venue. Soon, the tragedy was confirmed,” she said. ‘Delay in opening gate’ CUSAT Vice-Chancellor P G Sankaran said there were two factors that contributed to the stampede that took place after rain started pouring down. “There was a delay in opening the only gate to the auditorium. Hence, when students crowded at the only gate, it had to be opened all of a sudden. Besides, the stairs down to the amphitheatre are very steep,” he said.

Hundreds of BJP  workers accompanied him to the police station on Wednesday.","urlToImage":"https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/11/Suresh-Gopi.jpg?w=640","content":"Malayalam film actor and former BJP Rajya Sabha MP Suresh Gopi on Wednesday turned up before the police in Kerala’s Kozhikode, where he is facing a sexual harassment case following an interaction with journalists last month. Hundreds of BJP workers, led by party state president K Surendran and several senior leaders, accompanied Gopi to the police station and waited outside as officials started questioning the actor. On October 28, the Kozhikode city police had registered a case against Gopi under Section 354 A (sexual harassment of nature of unwelcome physical contact and explicit sexual overtures) based on a complaint from a journalist working with a TV channel. After the police served a notice to the actor, the BJP launched a campaign saying the party will not allow the government to target the leader, who is keen to contest the next Lok Sabha elections from Thrissur. The incident took place on October 27 when the actor-turned-politician was taking questions from reporters in Kozhikode. When the journalist asked Gopi a question, he put a hand on her shoulder and called her “mole (daughter)” as he began his answer. She backed away but when she asked another question later, he placed his hand on her shoulder once again, at which point she pushed it away. Following the controversy over the incident, Gopi apologised. In a Facebook post, he said that he had behaved in “an affectionate manner” towards the journalist. “If she felt bad about my behaviour, her feelings should be respected. I tender an apology towards her if she felt bad about my behaviour. Sorry…,” he said. However, the journalist said the apology was unacceptable and she would go ahead with the case. The BJP, meanwhile, picked up a fight with the Kerala Union of Working Journalists (KUWJ), which also lodged a complaint with the Kerala Women’s Commission.","category":"kerala"},{"publishedAt":"2024-10-07","title":"‘Sister in hospital, please help’: Ex-Coal India exec loses Rs 40,000 in Kerala’s first deepfake case","description":"City police commissioner Rajpal Meena said this is the first arrest in a cyber crime using deepfake technology – wherein facial appearance is manipulated through deep generative methods.","urlToImage":"https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/11/illustration.jpg?w=640","content":"Early morning on July 9, when Kozhikode resident Radhakrishan P S looked at his phone, he noticed a series of WhatsApp messages from an unknown number. A friend of four decades introduced himself, shared family photos, and details of their mutual friends. Soon, he got a WhatsApp call from that number, and the friend asked for Rs 40,000 for his sister’s surgery. As Radhakrishan remained noncommittal, the friend came on video call. In Radhakrishan’s mind, little doubt remained. It was his friend Venu Kumar, whom he had worked with in Coal India for decades before retiring. He sent him the money on GPay. By daybreak, Kerala’s first suspected AI deepfake fraud was born. Four months in, Kozhikode city police on Friday cracked the case, arresting one of the alleged accused, Shaik Murtuzamiya Hayat Bhai (43), from Mehsana in Gujarat. Police say he allegedly arranged fake bank accounts for the prime accused, Kaushal Shah from Ahmedabad, who is on the run. City police commissioner Rajpal Meena said this is the first arrest in a cyber crime using deepfake technology – wherein facial appearance is manipulated through deep generative methods. Prima facie, police believe Kaushal was the one who allegedly used deepfake technology to impersonate a friend of the complainant during a video call. Kozhikode cyber crime inspector Dinesh Koroth said the amount debited from the account was transferred to an account of a person in Ahmedabad. From there, it was transferred to the account of a gambling firm, where Kaushal is a regular. Eventually, the money would return to Kaushal as wins from gambling – a strategy employed to mislead police. Inspector Koroth said the police reached Shaik from Kaushal’s call detail records. According to them, Shaik maintained several bank accounts taken in the names of poor people who were not linked to the crime. “We have come to know that the accused were involved in cases of similar nature in Gujarat and Karnataka,” said the officer. Police said Kaushal is believed to have got details of the complainant and his friend from a WhatsApp group of former company employees. Kaushal, police said, is a B.Com graduate and comes from an affluent family. “We have learnt that his relatives and friends have complained about his cheating habit. Banks have also filed civil cases against him,” said the inspector. Recalling the incident on July 9, Radhakrishnan, who retired from Coal India 12 years ago as a senior executive, said he did not doubt when the person who sent a flurry of messages identified himself as Venu Kumar. “We had known each other for four decades. He started sending messages about my family and shared photos of his family. When I was going through these messages, I got a WhatsApp voice call from that number.” “There was no reason to doubt his voice, which I had been familiar with for decades. He told me that he was at Dubai airport and would reach Mumbai that evening. His sister was in hospital and Rs 40,000 was needed for surgery. He told me that he would return the money once he reached Mumbai. He asked me to transfer Rs 40,000 to a bystander’s account. When I started to raise doubts, he immediately made a video call. His image and voice were so clear that I had no reason to doubt things anymore. He WhatsApped a number, to which I credited the amount,” he said. Radhakrishan became suspicious after the fraudster demanded another Rs 35,000. “I felt something was fishy then. When he insisted on the second payment, I hung up the call.” Radhakrishan then made a call to Venu Kumar, who lives in Andhra Pradesh, on his phone number that he found on a WhatsApp group of former Coal India executives. “When I called Venu, he was excited to talk to me after many years. When I shot back that we had already talked in the morning and I had transferred money to him, he was stunned. Then I realised it was a scam, and I filed a complaint with the cyber police,’’ he said.","category":"kerala"},{"publishedAt":"2024-10-07","title":"We can’t be neutral when section of people face genocidal aggression, says Kerala CM on Israel-Palestine conflict","description":"\"Our Palestinian brothers are suffering.

The CM also alleged that Israel was targeting Palestine with the support of the US. “Our Palestinian brothers are suffering. We all know that with the support of America, Israel is targeting Palestine and the people there are facing genocidal aggression. We cannot take a neutral stand. We need to express our solidarity with the people of Palestine,” Vijayan said. He was speaking after inaugurating the concluding ceremony of the ‘Keraleeyam’ 2023 celebration which showcased the state’s progress, achievements, and cultural heritage to the world. Addressing the gathering here, Vijayan said the massive participation of the people shows that Keraleeyam was a huge success. The CM also said the government will consider the suggestions and directions received during the 25 seminars that took place during the last seven days, as part of the event. The week-long event was inaugurated on Kerala Piravi Day on November 1. Senior BJP leader O Rajagopal attended the event and witnessed the concluding ceremony. Meanwhile, opposition Congress-led UDF and the BJP boycotted the event altogether alleging that the Keralayeeam was a ‘financial extravaganza’. The Chief Minister, in his speech, reiterated that the Keraleeyam festival will be continued in coming years. The programme was organised within a short time period of 75 days, he pointed out. “We assure you that all the suggestions and directions that came from the seminars organised here will be considered for the further development of Kerala and its society,” Vijayan said. He stressed the need for more central assistance for further development in many sectors including the coastal area and its community. Vijayan also called for a change in the union government’s National Rubber Policy in order to protect the interests of rubber farmers and the sector. Finance Minister K Balagopal, who spoke at the event said the Kanakakunnu venue of the Keralayeem alone witnessed a footfall of over a lakh every day. “It shows that lakhs of people visited Keraleeyam and it will be a platform for the further development of the state,” he said. In an apparent reference to the Congress party, Balagopal said those who criticise the event should at least raise their voice against the central government, which was ‘refusing’ to pay what is due to the state government. With 42 venues, 25 seminars aimed at shaping the future of New Kerala, exhibitions, food festivals, and grand art performances, the festival showcased Kerala’s commitment to secularism, unity, and unique culture, according to the government. During his concluding day speech, Vijayan elaborated on the southern state’s notable accomplishments in various fields, including the cultural renaissance, land reform, people-centric planning, poverty amelioration, universal literacy, accessible public healthcare, housing provisions for all, and so on.","category":"kerala"},{"publishedAt":"2024-10-07","title":"Week after Kalamassery blasts, Jehovah’s Witnesses gather again for prayer meeting","description":"The Jehovah's Witnesses community in India boasts 947 congregations and over 56,000 devoted ministers dedicated to sharing their interpretation of the Bible and promoting an understanding of God's kingdom, according to the official jw.org website.","urlToImage":"https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/11/jehovah-witness-prayer-meeting.jpg?w=640","content":"Jehovah’s Witnesses, a Christian religious group whose prayer meeting in Kochi was marred by devastating bomb blasts a week ago, on Sunday resumed physical prayer meetings after holding online gatherings following the shocking incident that claimed the lives of three persons and injured over 50 others. The religious group decided to return to physical prayer meetings to remove any fear from its members’ minds following the blasts. The Jehovah’s Witnesses traces its origins to 19th century America. The group in Kalamassery faced a major shock when one of its estranged members — Dominic Martin — carried out multiple blasts at one of its conventions last Sunday by using an improvised explosive device (IED). Prior to surrendering before the police, Martin released a video stating that the group’s preachings were “seditious” and that they did not heed his warnings to change their ways, and that is why he carried out the attack. Three people, including a 12-year-old girl, lost their lives and over 50 were injured in the incident. Presently, according to a Health Department release, 20 persons are under treatment with 10 of them in intensive care and two in critical condition. The remaining eight persons are in the wards, it said. Subsequently, prayer meetings, usually held twice a week in local ‘Kingdom Halls’ — which refers to a local Jehovah’s Witnesses meeting place where religious services are held — were conducted online. “We decided to return to live (physical) meetings from today to remove the fear from people’s minds. The online meetings were held only for a few days following the blasts,” T A Sreekumar, a spokesperson of the group’s India Branch in Kerala, told PTI. On being asked whether there were any additional security arrangements in place for these meetings, he said that they already had a security system in place. “But we have asked everyone to be vigilant and cautious,” he added. Under the existing security system, members are examined before they enter the ‘Kingdom Halls’ and background checks are carried out of unknown persons, he said. “An enhanced security may be required in case of larger conventions and if the police say there need to be more security arrangements, we will ensure that,” Sreekumar said. The bomb blasts last Sunday took place on the last day of a three-day prayer convention held at Kalamassery here, which was attended by over 2,000 members from across the state. However, the prayer meetings at the ‘Kingdom Halls’ are much smaller affairs. “These are small gatherings of 50-60 members and everyone knows each other. No outsider can merely walk in like in churches or temples,” Sreekumar said. The Jehovah’s Witnesses community in India boasts 947 congregations and over 56,000 devoted ministers dedicated to sharing their interpretation of the Bible and promoting an understanding of God’s kingdom, according to the official jw.org website. Unlike mainstream Christian denominations, Jehovah’s Witnesses do not believe in the Holy Trinity (God, the Father; God, the Son – Jesus; and God the Holy Spirit) but worship Jehovah as the “the God of the Bible and the Creator of all things”. Followers of the group see Jesus Christ as the son of God, and not God himself. They learn from the teachings and examples set by Christ; hence they consider themselves Christians.","category":"kerala"},{"publishedAt":"2024-10-07","title":"Food vlogger found dead at his residence in Kerala","description":"The vlogger was part of 'Eat Kochi Eat', a popular online platform for foodies in which they introduce the least explored food joints in the city.","urlToImage":"https://images.indianexpress.com/2023/11/vlogger.jpg?w=640","content":"Noted food vlogger from Kochi, Rahul N Kutty, was found dead at his residence on Saturday, police said.

Today also, he got up early and went out on his two-wheeler. His wife thought he was going to meet his friend as he had told her the previous night,” said Sakkir Thammanam, the local councillor who is one of the very few people in the locality who can claim to know Martin, said to be aged 57. Hours after the blasts at a convention centre that left three dead, as of now, and several injured, Martin, an estranged member of Jehovah’s Witnesses, posted a video on social media taking responsibility for the act. Martin and his family – wife, son and daughter – have been staying at a 2-bedroom house at Khader Lane for rent for the last five years. Their landlord, Jaleel, was shell-shocked.

He might have started drinking of late as per our our conversations with his wife. Also, he never defaulted on rent payment. There was nothing suspicious about his activities,” said Jaleel. “I had been following the news of the blasts from the morning and suddenly in the afternoon, his wife came down and told me about his video in which he took ownership of the crime. She was apologetic that because of him, there would be so much issues for us and all the people in the locality,” added Jaleel. Martin, who hails from Elamkulam in Kochi, studied only till Class 10, as per Sakkir’s knowledge. Dominic left Jehovah’s Witnesses five or six years ago and returned to the group about two months ago. “He was running a spoken English tutorial in Thammanam a few years ago. When that started to taper off, he went to the Gulf more than two years ago. He came back just a couple of months ago and was planning to start some shop if I reckon right,” said Sakkir, adding that Martin is the youngest of seven siblings. Since the news of his confession and arrest broke out, his wife and daughter have been shattered. “They have not eaten anything. We have been constantly keeping in touch with them and trying to give them all the support. It’s nothing of their fault that he did this act,” said Jaleel. Elamkulam is his hometown. He came back from Gulf after his daughter contracted dengue. He never had any issues wtith anyone.","category":"kerala"},{"publishedAt":"2024-10-07","title":"Kochi Convention Centre Blasts Highlights: All-party meet resolves to resist efforts to create intolerance, mistrust","description":"Kochi Convention Centre Blasts Highlights: A series of blasts took place at a hall in Kalamassery in Kochi.

The government’s clarification came amidst a raging row over financial transactions between Vijayan’s daughter T Veena’s firm and the minerals company. The Department of State Goods and Services Tax on Saturday informed Congress MLA Mathew Kuzhalnadan, who had raised corruption allegations against Veena, that the matter had been verified. Kuzhalnadan had raised corruption charges against the transaction between Veena’s firm and the Kochi-based minerals company. He had sought to know whether Veena had remitted IGST for the over Rs 1 crore that she had received from the minerals company. He also recently sought a vigilance probe into the corruption allegations. In a letter, the state tax department informed the Congress legislator that during the verification, it was found that the Veena’s company had remitted the IGST for the amount that she received from Cochin Minerals and Rutile Ltd. However, the brief letter didn’t mention any other details, including the amount she had paid as tax. Sources here said the GST Commissioner has already submitted a report in this regard to Finance Minister K N Balagopal. A controversy erupted in Kerala recently over some financial transactions between the Kochi-based private minerals company and Veena and her IT firm. Evidence also cropped up that showed the company had dealings with top leaders of both the ruling CPI(M) as well as the opposition Congress-led UDF. The issue came to the fore after a Malayalam daily reported that Cochin Minerals and Rutile Ltd paid a total of Rs 1.72 crore to the CM’s daughter between 2017 and 2020.

While engineering students often have a stronger foundation in mathematics, with the right strategies and consistent practice, non-engineers can excel in this section as well. Here’s a comprehensive guide to help non-engineers prepare for the QA section of CAT with confidence. Understand the syllabus and focus areas The first step to effective preparation is understanding the syllabus. The QA section covers topics such as percentages, ratios, time-speed-distance, geometry and algebra. Typically, 22 questions are asked in this section. Non-engineers should prioritise topics that have high weightage but require relatively less effort to master, such as arithmetic and algebra. Focusing on these areas can help build a strong foundation for tackling the section. Brush up on basic mathematics For many non-engineers, mathematics may not have been a focus area after high school. However, revisiting basic concepts can make a significant difference in preparation. Topics such as arithmetic and algebra form the basis for nearly 60 per cent of the QA section. Aspirants can start by revisiting these topics and gradually move on to more advanced concepts. A variety of study materials, including books and online resources, are available to help candidates reinforce their understanding of basic mathematics. Practice consistently and learn shortcuts Consistency is key to mastering the QA section. Non-engineers should aim to solve 15-20 questions daily, starting with simpler problems and gradually progressing to more complex ones. It is important to time these practice sessions to simulate exam conditions and improve time management skills. Learning shortcut techniques for calculations, such as quick methods for square roots, percentages, and mental arithmetic, can significantly reduce problem-solving time and boost overall efficiency during the exam. Take mock tests and analyse performance Mock tests play a crucial role in CAT preparation. Regularly taking full-length mock exams helps aspirants familiarise themselves with the exam format and assess their performance. Many online platforms offer mock tests specifically designed for CAT preparation. Experts recommend taking at least 20-30 mock tests before the exam, as this practice can improve overall scores by up to 20 per cent. After each test, it is essential to analyse performance, identify areas of improvement, and work on weak spots to build confidence. Strengthen mental math Strong mental math skills can save valuable time during the exam. Daily exercises focused on quick additions, subtractions, and multiplications can help improve speed and accuracy. Over time, these mental calculations will become second nature, allowing candidates to focus more on problem-solving strategies rather than basic arithmetic. For non-engineers, mastering the CAT QA section is achievable with the right approach. Focusing on understanding fundamental concepts, practicing regularly, and building mental math skills can lead to substantial improvements in speed and accuracy. Staying consistent, motivated, and celebrating small milestones along the way will help build confidence. Ultimately, success in the QA section is less about an engineering background and more about disciplined preparation and effective time management.

Being a woman born in a rural area of Uttar Pradesh, life threw several challenges at her. But her resolve to make a difference helped her bag several achievements.","urlToImage":"https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/10/life-in-an-iit-copy_1.jpg?w=640","content":"— Robin Rathi Hailing from a small village called Kamaruddinnagar in Muzaffarnagar, Uttar Pradesh, I grew up in a joint family of 25 members where hierarchy and tradition held significant importance. Being a girl in a rural area brought its own challenges, where opportunities seemed limited, and education was rarely a priority. Despite this, I always had a burning desire to break stereotypes and create a better future for myself and the girls in my family. My parents supported me to the best of their ability, though I faced limitations—attending nearby schools, no tuition, and inadequate infrastructure. After completing my Class 12 exams in a Hindi-medium Uttar Pradesh board school, I became the pride of my family when I scored the highest marks in the area. My family started to see a future for me in engineering, though sending me away to study wasn’t an easy decision. In a display of tremendous support, my uncle and aunt moved to Delhi with me so I could pursue my BTech in Aeronautical Engineering at a private college. This gesture was a significant sacrifice for them, and while the financial strain was evident, it fuelled my determination to succeed. In 2013, I decided to take the Graduate Aptitude Test in Engineering (GATE) exam, recognising it as the key to higher education in India’s premier institutes. With the help of friends and coaching materials, I successfully cleared GATE, securing admission to Punjab Engineering College (PEC) for a masters in engineering. This experience opened up my world, broadening my perspective on problem-solving and developing my passion for research. It was at PEC that I realized research was my true calling. Life in IIT: A new beginning at IIT Madras After my master’s, I got an opportunity to work on a DRDO project at IIT Madras in 2017, which gave me exposure to cutting-edge research. I met several scientists and explored various DRDO labs, helping refine my approach to research. Life in Chennai was not without its challenges. Adjusting to the extreme humidity and heat after coming from the cooler climes of Uttar Pradesh was tough. The cultural differences, including language barriers, were initially overwhelming, but over time, I embraced the diversity of the IIT Madras community, including the campus, vibrant with students, faculty, and opportunities, which gave me a sense of belonging. In January 2018, I got married, and my husband, who was also pursuing his master’s at IIT Madras, joined me on this journey. He has just started his startup in the energy storage field along with his studies. In 2021, I officially joined IIT Madras as a PhD student under the guidance of Prof Tiju Thomas from Metallurgical and Materials Engineering and Prof Satyanarayanan Chakravarthy from Aerospace Engineering. My research focuses on solid propellant rocket fuel, a challenging but exciting field. Balancing academic and personal life has been both rewarding and challenging. After starting my PhD, I knew passing the comprehensive written and viva exams was crucial for staying in the programme. I was pregnant at the time, so I aimed to finish my coursework quickly. In six months, I completed everything with a CGPA of 9.23 and cleared the comprehensive exam. Just two days later, in February 2023, my daughter was born. During maternity leave, my workaholic nature kicked in, and I felt the need to stay active. I joined various clubs, became the head of Hindi Mitra Mandal, and an executive in the Research Affairs Council, organising workshops and events. I also took entrepreneurship training and joined the G20 programme in Gurugram as a cyber volunteer, even being honored by the Home Minister. I confidently carried my newborn along to all these activities, motivated to keep pushing boundaries. Balancing motherhood while pursuing my PhD in rocket science was never going to be easy. But my determination to set an example for her, and for other women who face similar challenges, kept me going. In 2024, I ran for the position of Research Affairs Secretary (RAS), a decision that raised many eyebrows. Could a mother with a toddler lead one of the most significant student bodies on campus? With the unshakable support of my husband, parents, and brothers, I campaigned, determined to break the stigma surrounding working mothers. Winning the election was a testament to my resolve, and I now oversee several key initiatives at IIT Madras, including the Placement & Internship Cell, Skill Development Cell, and the Outbound Training (OBT) Program. The sense of responsibility and fulfillment I get from contributing to the institute’s growth and well-being is indescribable. Future Plans: Shaping lives beyond the lab Looking forward, my dreams are twofold – to excel in rocket science research and to give back to my community. After completing my PhD, I aspire to contribute to the field of aerospace, possibly as an academician or researcher. I also have entrepreneurial ambitions, hoping to leverage my knowledge to create jobs and opportunities for the younger generation. Moreover, I am passionate about addressing the educational challenges that still exist in my village. I plan to set up a career consultancy focused on empowering rural girls, helping them break the cycle of limitations that I once faced. With the support of my mentors, family, and the IIT Madras community, I feel empowered to take on the challenges ahead. In everything I do, I carry the lessons learned from my journey—dedication, perseverance, and the belief that education can transform lives.","category":"education"},{"publishedAt":"2024-10-07","title":"UPSC IFS 2024: Mains exam from November 24, complete schedule here","description":"UPSC 2024: The examination will be conducted from November 24 and will conclude on December 1.

With over 20 lakh candidates appearing for the exam in 2023, the competition has reached unprecedented levels. This article delves into the intricacies of the NEET UG exam pattern, offering valuable insights for students aiming to secure a place in the country’s top medical institutions. Exam structure overview The NEET UG exam will comprise 200 multiple-choice questions (MCQs) distributed across three subjects – physics, chemistry and biology (botany and zoology). Candidates are required to attempt 180 of these 200 questions. Each subject is divided into two sections – section A and section B. While section A contains 35 mandatory questions, section B presents 15 questions, of which students must answer 10. This format introduced an element of choice, allowing candidates to strategically select questions that align with their strengths. The marking scheme remains consistent with previous years. Read | NEET UG 2025: Importance of solving mock tests Subject-wise strategy Developing a tailored approach for each subject is essential for maximizing scores in the NEET UG examination. Physics: This subject often proves challenging for many aspirants. Focus on understanding fundamental concepts and their applications rather than memorising formulas. High-weightage topics such as mechanics, thermodynamics, and modern physics deserve special attention. Practice solving numerical problems regularly to build problem-solving skills and speed. Chemistry: Balancing organic, inorganic, and physical chemistry is crucial. For organic chemistry, emphasise reaction mechanisms and named reactions. In inorganic chemistry, periodic table trends and coordination compounds are vital. Physical chemistry requires a strong grasp of thermodynamics and chemical equilibrium. Creating concise notes and mnemonic devices can aid in retaining complex information. Biology: As the subject with the highest weightage, biology demands thorough preparation. Concentrate on human physiology, genetics, and ecology, as these areas frequently appear in the exam. Understanding biological processes and their interrelationships is more valuable than rote memorisation. Importance of NCERT The significance of NCERT (National Council of Educational Research and Training) textbooks in NEET preparation cannot be overstated. These books serve as the primary source for a majority of questions, particularly in biology. The language and presentation of concepts in NCERT texts closely mirror the exam’s question style. For biology, a thorough study of NCERT materials can potentially cover up to 90 per cent of the questions. While additional resources may be necessary for advanced problem-solving in physics and chemistry, NCERT books provide the essential conceptual foundation. Aspirants should read NCERT textbooks multiple times, focusing on diagrams, tables, and highlighted points. Creating summaries of each chapter can reinforce understanding and serve as quick reference materials during revision. Time management techniques Effective time management is often the differentiating factor between success and failure in the NEET UG exam. The following strategies can help optimise time usage: Sectional time allocation: Divide the total time (3 hours) among subjects based on individual strengths and the number of questions. A common approach is to allocate 60 minutes each for physics and chemistry and 90 minutes for biology. Two-pass strategy: In the first pass, attempt all questions that can be answered confidently. Mark difficult questions for review and return to them in the second pass. Question selection in Section B: Quickly scan all 15 questions and select the 10 most comfortable ones to attempt. This approach maximises the chance of scoring in the optional section. Balanced approach: Maintain a balance between speed and accuracy. Since the exam entails negative marking, its important to know which questions you can attempt and which you are better off leaving. Practice with a timer: Regular timed practice using mock tests helps in developing a sense of pacing and reduces exam-day stress. Role of practice The adage “practice makes perfect” holds particularly true for NEET UG preparation. Regular and structured practice is essential for success in this highly competitive exam. Mock tests play a crucial role in familiarising students with the exam pattern and improving their time management skills. They also help identify strengths and weaknesses, allowing for targeted preparation in the weeks before the exam. Solving previous years’ question papers is equally important. This practice exposes students to the types of questions asked and helps them understand the evolution of the exam pattern over time. It’s best to attempt these papers under exam-like conditions to simulate the actual test experience. Success in the NEET UG exam requires a multifaceted approach combining thorough subject knowledge, strategic preparation, and effective time management. By understanding the exam pattern, focusing on high-yield topics, utilising NCERT resources effectively, managing time wisely, and engaging in consistent practice, aspirants can significantly enhance their chances of achieving their dream of entering the medical profession. As the healthcare sector in India continues to grow, the rewards of succeeding in NEET UG extend far beyond academic achievement, opening doors to a fulfilling career in one of the nation’s most vital industries.

AI is now a common tool for students and teachers alike, transforming the way homework is done and how lesson plans are created. Several teachers around the country are now battling with the pros and cons of the new technology. While some may take help of AI to fool-proof their lesson plans, ensure there are no mistakes in question papers etc, others are struggling to keep children away from relying completely on this newfound genie. Read | World Teachers’ Day today; theme this year, significance ‘We are smarter than you’ “A couple of my students have submitted an essay assignment generated out of AI services such as ChatGPT, but they forget that we are their teachers and we think two steps ahead. As a norm, I now run all of my assignments through AI detectors, which are easily available online. When students have tried to play smart with me, I have always asked them to redo their assignment. A student of mine last month told me how he decided never to use AI in homework again because it doubled the work for him,” a Hindi teacher from Pune shared with indianexpress.com. Teachers are also having to get more careful in checking for AI now as they fear that students are more technologically advanced than them. “I come from Yahoo Messenger era, and therefore it took me time to adjust to the new normal. However, things are pretty simple if you just read online tutorials. But I am more vigilant now because students are well-versed with technology,” the teacher added. The increasing use of AI in education also brings challenges. As Asif Zaman Ahmed, a teacher from Naliapool Bengali High School in Dibrugarh, Assam, points out AI’s ability to provide instant answers often leads students to depend on it for quick solutions. This, in turn, diminishes their motivation to engage in deeper thinking and intellectual challenges. “Students are becoming impatient,” said Ahmed. “They want immediate results and are less inclined to work through difficult problems, which is essential for developing critical thinking.” Meanwhile, teachers are also using AI as their little helper. Seema Saberwal, a teacher at Amity International School Noida, uses AI to tailor lesson plans to individual student needs but refrains from using AI to frame questions or evaluate student progress. “Over-reliance on AI can diminish human interaction, compromise data privacy, and overlook the complexities of human learning,” Saberwal said. “To offer an experience beyond AI’s reach, we use human-centric approaches like storytelling to share personal anecdotes, historical context or social implications, role-playing to develop empathy through real-world scenarios, and group discussions to encourage critical thinking and foster constructive feedback among students,” she added. AI: Genius in disguise, but without emotions While AI has become everyone’s best friend, it still lacks the human touch that a teacher possesses. Since teachers are able to compare students’ offline and online performance, checking if the assignments are AI-generated gets a tad easier for them. “I know those students personally so I can compare their in-class performance with their on-paper assignment and assess within seconds if the student has had any help,” the Pune teacher added. Additionally, it is also being argued that while AI continues to revolutionise education, it cannot replace the human connection, creativity and ethical guidance that only teachers can provide. Take, for example, Vishwendra Gurjar, a government school teacher in Rajasthan. When one of his students lost a family member, Vishwendra didn’t just grant extensions on homework assignments but became a mentor, offering emotional support and helping the student navigate grief while staying on track academically. Blending technology with traditional teaching methods The COVID-19 pandemic rapidly accelerated the integration of technology into education. While AI and digital platforms became crucial tools during remote learning, they couldn’t replace the empathy, creativity, and sense of community fostered by in-person teaching. “We’ve blended technology with traditional teaching methods, but we have focused on reducing technology-based homework. Instead, we emphasise hands-on tasks and reflective activities that encourage students to apply what they’ve learned in meaningful ways,” explained Anju Soni, principal of Shiv Nadar School, Noida. The hands-on tasks such as building, crafting, and designing physical models foster creativity, problem-solving, and the satisfaction of creating something tangible — experiences that AI cannot replace, the principal added. “We also integrate activities that develop emotional intelligence, empathy, teamwork, and communication skills, helping students form emotional connections — an aspect that AI cannot emulate. Encouraging collaboration in group projects allows students to communicate, negotiate, and work toward shared goals, building teamwork and leadership skills that AI tools cannot replicate,” she added. Ahmed and other educators are addressing this issue by fostering debates about the pros and cons of AI in learning through empathetic relationships and a focus on creativity, they help students overcome AI-driven hurdles. “We encourage students to take risks, think independently, and learn from mistakes — skills that AI can’t nurture,” Ahmed said. Another area where AI falls short is in fostering a sense of community and belonging. Teachers create inclusive classroom environments where students collaborate, form friendships, and build social skills. While AI-powered tools may personalise learning experiences, they cannot replicate the emotional bonds that students form with their peers and teachers in a dynamic classroom setting.","category":"education"},{"publishedAt":"2024-10-07","title":"IIT Tirupati scholarships for UG, PG students","description":"IIT Tirupati Scholarships: Over the last three years, the institute has been placed within the top 100 in the engineering category in the Education Ministry’s National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF).","urlToImage":"https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/04/Unsplash_af91ac.jpg?w=640","content":"IIT Tirupati scholarships: The Indian Institute of Technology Tirupati (IIT Tirupati) provides yearly scholarships to meritorious students.

The provisional answer key is already out. UGC NET is held to determine the eligibility for the assistant professor post as well as a junior research fellowship in Indian universities. It is conducted by the National Testing Agency (NTA) on behalf of the UGC. It was in news due to cancellation of exam after reports of paper leak, CBI’s investigation revealing there was no paper leak, re-exam and postponement of re-exam. Was UGC NET paper leaked? A few hours after the UGC Chief, M Jagadesh Kumar, had tweeted that the NTA had “successfully conducted UGC-NET June 2024” on June 18, the Ministry of Education (MoE) later announced the cancellation of the exam. This happened just a day after over 9 lakh candidates appeared for it across 317 cities, following inputs from the Union Ministry of Home Affairs that “the integrity of the examination may have been compromised”. However, it was a few weeks later that the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) ruled out any paper leak. After a thorough investigation, the CBI revealed that the “evidence”, which led the Education Ministry to cancel the exam was doctored. The input was a screenshot of a UGC-NET paper circulating on a Telegram channel around 2 pm on the exam day (June 18), with messages and comments suggesting it was leaked before the first session. This chatter on Telegram channels was detected by the Indian Cybercrime Coordination Centre (I4C) under the MHA, and relayed to the UGC on June 19. Based on this input, the government announced the cancellation later that night. Government sources later told The Indian Express that the said screenshot of the question paper was manipulated in a way to create the impression that it was available before the examination. After the report was made public, the India-Wide Parents Association (IWPA) urged MoE, NTA and UGC to not re-conduct the exam as it will be ‘unjustified and an injustice to lakh of candidates’. Postponement of UGC-NET re-exam: Mismanagement or hyped chaos? While stakeholders demanded cancellation of the re-exam, NTA announced that the UGC-NET re-exam will be conducted from August 21 to September 4. However, on August 14 the NTA announced another postponement of the exam. Details June 2024 (first exam) Total Registered Candidates 11,21,225 Total Appeared Candidates 9,08,580 (81%) First Shift Registered Candidates 5,80,833 Second Shift Registered Candidates 5,40,392 First Shift Appeared Candidates 4,73,484 Second Shift Appeared Candidates 4,35,096 In a notification, the agency said that due to Krishna Janmashtami on August 26, the exams that were to take place on the same date will now be conducted on August 27. The rest schedule of the UGC NET will remain the same. On August 26, NTA had to conduct the following exams: philosophy, Hindi, Oriya, Nepali, Manipuri, Assamese, and Santali, all seven language papers. The exams were then held on August 27, 28, 29 and 30 and September 2, 3, 4 and 5. Even during the rescheduled exam, four centres saw last-minute cancellations and further rescheduling, with the reason cited as technical glitches/floods. The four affected centres are Dr Ghanshyam Singh College of Education in Uttar Pradesh’s Varanasi, Shankara Group of Institutions in Rajasthan’s Jaipur, Amatyas Global IT Solution in Gujarat’s Jamnagar, and Jainee College of Engineering and Technology in Tamil Nadu’s Dindigul. These exams were scheduled on August 21, 27 and 28 in different shifts. The re-exam was then conducted on September 4 from 3 to 6 pm. Later when the provisional answer keys were finally released, students claimed that the answer keys were riddled with errors, having as many as over 30 incorrect answers out of the 150 total questions in some disciplines. “Specifically, in the History exam, candidates reported as many as 35 confirmed incorrect answers in the provisional answer key for one shift. Even after growing complaints, NTA’s initial response was to ask the students to keep challenging suspected questions, even if require for the entire paper. When candidates raised concerns regarding having to pay exorbitant amounts of money, essentially for NTA to fix its mistakes, the provisional answer key for History was quietly changed on the portal with no official notification or acknowledgement,” says 24-year-old Shefali Jain from Noida, who appeared for the exam, both times for Political Science. When candidates thought their wait was finally over, they were left in lurch as the UGC and NTA failed to release the final answer keys and result for the re-exam. While the provisional answer keys were released on September 11, there is no sign of the final answer key and result. Several calls and messages from indianexpress.com about an update have gone unanswered. Some students, too, have been reaching out to the UGC Chief through social media platform ‘X’ (earlier know as Twitter). “I DM-ed the UGC Chief on X requesting him to at least tweet an update about our result, but there has been no reply and no update. We feel stuck,” shares Isha Bhola, a 23-year-old who appeared for UGC NET exam for English and Linguistics. NTA usually releases the final answer key 3-4 days after the objection window for provisional answer key concludes, and the result is published either on the same day or the following day. However, it is about to be a month since the provisional answer key was released, and the delay in the result declaration is costing students several opportunities. “Our PhD admissions are relying on this score. I wanted to apply in DU and JNU, both of whose process was supposed to be completed by August or September, but those institutes have also had to wait now due to UGC and NTA’s delay. I am even unable to apply for jobs because my result is not out yet. I have calculated my score and I have hopes for JRF, which means I can also apply for scholarships but the applications for those are also closing. There was even a vacancy for JRF assistant in Delhi university’s Rajdhani College, which I have missed due to this delay. It basically means that I have been sitting idle for the past 2-3 months, and it is starting to disturb my mental health now,” Isha added.","category":"education"},{"publishedAt":"2024-10-07","title":"IGNOU December 2024 TEE assignment submission deadline extended","description":"IGNOU 2024: All the assignments which have to be submitted in hard copy or soft copy have got the extension.","urlToImage":"https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/06/IGNOU-1.jpg?w=640","content":"The Indira Gandhi National Open University (IGNOU) has extended the assignment submission deadline till October 31.

IIT Dhanbad wasn’t registered with us either. “So, I called up the institute’s registrar, who turned out to be from Kannauj (Arun’s assembly constituency). It has been decided that IIT Dhanbad would be registered with us immediately, possibly by Thursday, so that the channel for disbursing scholarships is quickly in place,” he added. Currently, three Uttar Pradesh government departments — Social Welfare, Backward Welfare and Minorities Welfare — disburse scholarships. The Department of Social Welfare is the nodal department for all scholarships and framing rules for it, Arun said. He said his department will also issue a “free-ship card” to Kumar. “This card facility, started this year itself, allows eligible students to enrol in an institution and on the basis of that card, this student will be able to secure what was earlier referred to as the zero-balance-admission,” the minister said. Earlier, Arun spoke to Kumar’s family over phone and assured them that the state government would provide financial assistance for his education.","category":"education"},{"publishedAt":"2024-10-07","title":"Battling health problems, this Odisha village boy cracks NEET-UG: ‘Steve Jobs quote on connecting dots inspired me’","description":"When asked whether he was nervous during the exam, he said “My preparation was strong and I always considered my question paper as a patient and the examination hall as an operation theatre.","urlToImage":"https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/09/Unsplash-1.jpg?w=640","content":"Despite facing health problems, Sekh Galib Raza cracked NEET UG 2024 in his fourth attempt.

The conduct of the member must be probed. We understand Prime Minister Narendra Modi has set up the panel on the Waqf Bill with noble intentions to consider views from various sections,” AIPMM chief and former Rajya Sabha MP Ali Anwar Ansari told The Indian Express. In his letter to the parliamentary panel’s chief Jagadambika Pal, Ansari said no attempts must be made by any member of the committee to create doubts about its confidentiality. “We saw a statement by a committee member (Dubey) that the JCP had received about 1.25 crore suggestions … There was a demand for an investigation of the origin of suggestions as some of them came from those suspected to have a ‘radical Islamic image and alleged links to the ISI’. We want to know on what grounds the member made such a statement,” read the letter dated October 3. Ansari said members of the panel must be “warned against turning a sensitive issue into a communal one”. “Fundamentalist groups, individuals like Zakir Naik or foreign powers like the ISI (Pakistan) or China or their proxies may be involved given that 1.25 crore submissions have been received. If such forces are involved, it would be an attempt to manipulate our legislative process, an attack on the very foundations of our parliamentary system and must be treated as a national security issue,” Dubey had said last week. Ansari also urged Pal to fix a date, time, and place for the AIPMM to present its suggestions and objections regarding the Waqf Bill, claiming that it has been working for the cause of Muslims for over 25 years. “Just before the change in political power in 2014, the Waqf (Amendment) Act of 2013 was passed in Parliament. Even before the Bill was passed, the Joint Committee of Parliament (1996-2006) studied its historical background in great detail. You know that Justice Rajinder Sachar prepared an in-depth report on the issue of the participation of minorities in social power. The same Sachar Committee also mentioned that Waqfs across the country have 4,90,021 properties (page number 220). The concept of Waqf existed from the time when there was no power of pen, paper and law. Properties were donated as part of religious procedures…,” the letter observed. Claiming that there was a need for reform following the 2013 amendment to the Act, the AIPMM said an attempt to change the entire structure of an institution does not count as reform. “It is seen as an attempt to change the structure to suit one’s political, social and economic interests,” the letter read. Ansari said there had been a “clear intention to limit Muslim representation” to even less than 50%. “Political power wants to take control of the CEO’s post and is insisting on nominating members instead of electing them. The nomination of members by the state governments in Waqf Boards of the state leads to government interference in the management of Waqf properties,” he wrote. Even as the Sachar Committee report of 2004-2005 pegs its numbers at 40%, Pasmanda Muslims, considered to be “deprived and downtrodden”, are seen to make up almost 80-85% of the community’s population in India and are concentrated in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. Over the years and especially ahead of the recent Lok Sabha polls, the BJP had been trying to woo the Pasmandas after its 2022 Lok Sabha bypoll victories in Azamgarh and Rampur in UP, seen to have a considerable Muslim population. It is believed that the party’s good performance in the 2022 UP Assembly elections was due to it gaining some Pasmanda votes. It was during the BJP’s 2017 Odisha national executive that Modi mentioned the term Pasmanda Muslims clearly for the first time. During the Hyderabad conclave earlier this year, he mentioned it on both days and largely in the context of UP and Bihar.","category":"politics"},{"publishedAt":"2024-10-07","title":"Decode Politics: Why BJP has raised a stink about ‘toilet tax’ in Himachal Pradesh","description":"Though the Sukhu government withdrew the September 21 order within hours, the BJP is using it to target the Congress’s financial policy.","urlToImage":"https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/10/himachal-toilet-tax.jpg?w=640","content":"On September 21, the Himachal Pradesh government passed an order imposing monthly sewage charges for each toilet seat in urban households but withdrew it hours later. Two weeks later, this has emerged as the latest flashpoint between the Congress and the BJP in the hill state, with the latter targeting the Sukhvinder Singh Sukhu government for attempting to impose a “toilet tax”. The Congress has responded by accusing the previous BJP government led by Jairam Thakur of leaving the state in a financial crisis. What was the “toilet tax”? The state government last month revised water charges following Governor Shiv Pratap Shukla’s approval and a five-page notification was issued under the Himachal Pradesh Water Supply Act, 1968. Apart from levying a Rs 100 monthly charge for rural consumers, the notification revised water tariffs for urban consumers. It proposed to charge urban domestic consumers as well as government establishments Rs 200 per month, Rs 500 per month for commercial use, and Rs 2,500 each month for non-commercial and non-domestic establishments. Don't miss | J&K countdown begins, hits 5: Parties to legal experts, no clarity on nominated members Of the six revisions, the third clause of the notification sparked a row. “Where, in urban areas, some establishments use their own water sources and the department’s sewage system, sewage charges shall be levied at Rs 25 per seat per month,” read the notification. Though the clause was revoked hours later, reportedly on the directions of Deputy CM Mukesh Agnihotri who holds the Jal Shakti portfolio, the Opposition targeted the Sukhu government for imposing a “toilet tax” on people. How much does water cost in rural areas? In March 2022, the Thakur government waived the Rs 34 per connection charge in rural areas. His government also provided 125 units of electricity free of cost. After Sukhu assumed power, he reintroduced monthly water charges for rural consumers at Rs 100 per connection while announcing that they would be exempt from metering. The state government aimed to generate Rs 200 crore from the fees. “The water and sewage charges increase by 10% annually. Accordingly, the Rs 34 water charge will now be Rs 61. Earlier, there was no sewage system in rural areas but now, the National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD) has started building sewage projects and appropriate charges should be levied on the consumers. Going forward, if a rural consumer uses the government’s sewage system, he/she will have to pay 30% of the Rs 100 water charge,” a secretary-level officer in the Jal Shakti Department told The Indian Express. What does the BJP claim? BJP national president and Union Health Minister J P Nadda on Friday said at an event in Bilaspur that the Sukhu government was “100% corrupt and even taxed toilets”. Also in Political Pulse | Did Nehru insult Shivaji as Fadnavis claimed? What the former PM wrote about the Maratha king The same day, Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman took to X to target the Congress. “Unbelievable, if true! Whilst ⁦PM Narendra Modi ji builds Swachhata as a people’s movement, here is the Congress taxing people for toilets! Shame that they didn’t provide good sanitation during their time, but this step will shame the country!” A state government official admitted that the clause was intended to tax toilet seats. “There are many hotels and commercial establishments in urban areas that have their own water sources but use the government’s sewage system. The intention was to charge Rs 25 (per toilet seat) from these entities,” said the officer. On Saturday, speaking to reporters after the inauguration of a new BJP in Nahan, Thakur said Sukhu is the only CM to impose tax on toilets. “In just two years, the government has pushed the state back by 10 years. From the moment he took charge, Sukhu has only focused on increasing taxes. While the Swachh Bharat Mission is ongoing across India, and the Centre is investing to promote cleanliness and make the country open-defecation free, the Congress government and its CM wants to collect Rs 25 every month for each toilet seat,” he said. How has the Congress responded? Sukhu has accused the BJP of playing the religion card and raising “fabricated issues”. “The BJP is playing the religion card or raising fabricated issues like this so-called toilet tax. These are unfounded allegations aimed at misleading the public,” he said amid criticism from the Opposition party. The CM also accused the Thakur government of introducing several sops worth Rs 5,000 crore, including free water, to win the 2022 elections. “Despite these measures, the Congress was voted to power. The free water provision was even extended to five-star hotels, and the current government has since rationalised water subsidies, introducing a nominal Rs 100 charge per month in rural areas,” he said. What else has the Sukhu government reversed? Apart from the sewage charge, the Himachal government has also rolled back the previous administration’s decision to provide 125 free units of electricity in rural areas, while allowing 300 free units for Below the Poverty Line (BPL) families. However, the decision, announced in July, has not yet been implemented. In March, the Himachal Pradesh High Court quashed the government’s decision to collect water cess from hydroelectric plants in the state. A Department of Finance official said providing freebies would not be possible in the state. “Some schemes are funded by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and other international organisations with the condition that a specific amount needs to be recovered from consumers. Many schemes related to water supply and sewage fall in this category,” the officer said.","category":"politics"},{"publishedAt":"2024-10-07","title":"Did Nehru insult Shivaji as Fadnavis claimed? What the former PM wrote about the Maratha king","description":"In “The Discovery of India”, Nehru praised Shivaji’s courage and “high qualities of leadership” and criticised  Aurangzeb for “undoing his predecessors’ legacy.\"","urlToImage":"https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/10/Nehru-and-Shivaji-.jpg?w=640","content":"With the Maharashtra Assembly elections round the corner and close on the heels of a controversy over the collapse of a Shivaji statue in Sindhudurg, a war of words has broken out between the BJP and the Congress after Deputy Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis claimed that former Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru insulted the Maratha king in his book, “The Discovery of India”. This is the second time in as many months that Fadnavis has brought up the matter to counter the Opposition’s criticism over the collapse of the 35-foot statute at Rajkot Fort that Prime Minister Narendra Modi had unveiled last year. The row over the statue has the potential to hurt the Mahayuti alliance given the almost divine status of the Maratha king in Maharashtra and the key role he plays in shaping the Maharashtrian identity. On Saturday, responding to the Opposition Maha Vikas Aghadi’s (MVA) attacks over the statue collapse, Fadnavis said, “The agitation (over the statue collapse) is purely political. The MVA and Congress have never respected Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj. Nehru ji insulted Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj in The Discovery of India. Will Congress and MVA apologise for it?” He also accused the Congress of spreading falsehood by claiming Shivaji looted Surat. Last month, days after Fadnavis first raised the matter, BJP leader Narayan Rane said Shivaji had looted Surat. “I am not a historian. But from whatever I have read, heard, and known from historian Babasaheb Purandare, ‘Shivaji Maharaj ni Surat la loot keli (Shivaji Maharaj had looted Surat),’” he said. However, a quick reading of “The Discovery of India” shows that Nehru showered praises on the Maratha king and criticised Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb for “undoing his predecessors’ legacy”. Must Read | A statue falls and a controversy rises: Why did Shivaji statue sport a scar? “Shivaji, born in 1627, was the ideal guerilla leader of hardened mountaineers and his cavalry went far and wide, sacking the city of Surat, where the English had their factory, and enforcing the chowth tax payment over distant parts of the Mughal dominions. Shivaji was the symbol of a resurgent Hindu nationalism, drawing inspiration from the old classics, courageous, and possessing high qualities of leadership. He built up the Marathas as a strong unified fighting group, gave them a nationalist background, and made them a formidable power that broke up the Mughal empire,” Nehru wrote. The former PM also wrote that Aurangzeb “failed to understand the present and the immediate past … and tried to undo what his predecessors had done”. “A bigot and an austere puritan, he was no lover of art or literature. He infuriated the great majority of his subjects by imposing the old hated jezia poll tax on the Hindus and destroying many of their temples. He offended the proud Rajputs who had been props and pillars of the empire. In the north he roused the Sikhs, who, from being a peaceful sect representing some sort of synthesis of Hindu and Islamic ideas, were converted by repression and persecution into a military brotherhood. Near the west coast of India, he angered the warlike Marathas, descendants of the ancient Rashtrkutas, just when a brilliant captain had risen among them,” Nehru wrote. Also Read | Somnath: A brief history of the temple, and why Nehru opposed the President inaugurating it On Marathas, the former PM wrote, “Warren Hastings wrote in 1784, ‘The Marathas possess, alone of all the people in Hindustan and the Deccan, a principle of national attachment, which is strongly impressed on the minds of all individuals of the nation, and would probably unite their chiefs, as in one common cause, if any danger were to threaten the general state.’ Probably this national sentiment of theirs was largely confined to the Marathi speaking area. Nevertheless, the Marathas were catholic in their political and military system as well as their habits, and there was a certain internal democracy among them. All this gave strength to them. Shivaji, though he fought Aurangzeb, freely employed Muslims.” Responding to Fadnavis’s remarks, Congress leader Pawan Khera said Nehru had written to historian P R Devgirikar to seek references on Shivaji and had corrected some of the inaccuracies in the book in its second edition. “Nehru accepted his mistake and made corrections as he had written the first edition from prison without adequate resources,” Khera said.","category":"politics"},{"publishedAt":"2024-10-07","title":"J&K countdown begins, hits 5: Parties to legal experts, no clarity on nominated members","description":"Exit polls add to apprehension that no group may get clear majority, which would make role of nominated members, who nominates them, and in consultation with whom, crucial.","urlToImage":"https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/10/Untitled-design-2024-10-06T151829.277.jpg?w=640","content":"WITH THE exit polls also indicating that no party or coalition may end up with a simple majority in Jammu and Kashmir, the confusion regarding the five members to be nominated to the Assembly by the Lieutenant Governor has parties worried. As more Opposition leaders came forward to say that Lt Governor Manoj Sinha should not be making the nominations without the “aid and advice” of the Council of Ministers that is to be sworn in soon, the BJP has said he is clearly not required to as per the J&K Reorganisation Act. Several legal experts The Indian Express spoke to also differed over what the changes implied. The addition of the five nominated members, who are to have the same powers and voting rights as other MLAs, would take the total J&K House strength to 95, and the majority mark to 48. Most exit polls Saturday gave the National Conference-Congress alliance – the frontrunner – less than that figure. As per senior administration officials who refused to come on record, after the results are announced on October 8, three notifications will follow – one, for the constitution of the Assembly; second, for the return of powers to the Council of Ministers from the administrative secretaries; and third, the nomination of members. The NC’s state spokesperson Imran Nabi Dar told The Indian Express: “As a precedent, this (the nomination) has to be done by the elected government, not by somebody who is himself a nominated person, in this case, the LG.” Dar added that his party believed the Centre would not bypass the elected government. “If it is done, it would have implications on government formation. The LG does not have the authority to appoint members without the Council of Ministers being in place,” he said. Senior PDP leader and former minister Mehboob Beig said that nomination of members without a Council of Ministers being in place would mean “the BJP disrespecting or diluting the mandate of the people”. “If the number of seats is fixed at 90, how can they bring five more people from outside to decide the fate of the elected government? They should not do this.” “The most empowered” state of India, due to the special powers it enjoyed under Article 370, had already been downgraded to a Union Territory, Beig noted. Now that an election has finally been conducted, “the results should be respected”, he said. The chief spokesperson of the BJP in Jammu, Sunil Sethi, claimed there was no confusion on the issue. “The provisions of the J&K Reorganisation Act are very clear. We are following the Puducherry model and there the Centre has the power to nominate members.” According to Sethi, those spreading confusion over the matter are applying provisions applicable to J&K when it was a state. It is clear now that “nomination (of members to the Assembly) by the LG is to be on the advice of the Home Ministry”, he said. Even though the Act itself does not specify this, Sethi said, “because the LG is the nominee of the Centre, it will be on the advice of the Union Home Ministry”. Sethi also argued that since the five members have the right to vote, “they also have the right to vote for government formation, and that cannot be on the advice of the Council of Ministers”. “So they have to be nominated along with the constitution of the Legislative Assembly itself.” Passed after the abrogation of Article 370, the scrapping of special status and the division of J&K into two Union Territories, the J&K Reorganisation Act, cleared in 2019 by Parliament, specified that the LG – now the administrative authority – “may nominate two members to the Legislative Assembly” to give representation to women “if, in his opinion, women are not adequately represented in the Legislative Assembly”. Then, in 2023, an amendment was made to the Act, allowing for the nomination of three more members to the Assembly – two from the “Kashmiri migrant community”, one of whom has to be a woman; and one from “displaced persons from Pakistan-occupied Jammu and Kashmir”. Asked about what the changes implied, former J&K law secretary Mohammad Ashraf Mir pointed to how the rules governing this had changed. When J&K had its own Constitution, on all matters except those covered by Sections 36, 38 and 92 – on appointment of ministers, deputy ministers and imposition of Governor’s rule – “the Governor (was required to) act only on the aid and advice of ministers”. The matter of nomination of members was governed by Section 47, and hence it required the Governor to consult the Council of Ministers, Mir said. Then, the J&K Assembly had two nominated members, who were named after government formation and on the advice of the government of the day. But now the situation was different, Mir said. “There is (the J&K) Reorganisation Act and it states that the LG will act on the aid and advice of ministers in respect to matters where the state Legislature has the power to make laws. The rest is within his discretion.” The issue of nomination is “not within the powers or competence of the elected Assembly”, he said, meaning the LG had the discretion to nominate members to the Assembly. However, Shariq Riyaz, a lawyer practising in the J&K High Court as well as the Supreme Court, does not agree that the LG has power to “unilaterally nominate members to the Legislative Assembly”. “This is covered by a direct entry in the State List under the Seventh Schedule, as per which he has to act only on the ‘aid and advice’ of the Council of Ministers of the incoming government. Any misadventure must be interdicted in courts.” On the parallel drawn with Puducherry, where three members are nominated to the Union Territory’s Assembly by the Central government, Riyaz said: “Puducherry was always a UT, while J&K was a state that has been reorganised as a UT. Plus, in Puducherry, the Act states that the nomination (of members) will be by the Central government. The J&K Reorganisation Act states that the LG will nominate.” On the Central government’s role, Riyaz said that it has powers with regard to police, public order and the Union List. Additionally, he said, all these powers can be exercised only when the Assembly is in session. “Nomination can’t be done today, when the Assembly is not yet born.”","category":"politics"},{"publishedAt":"2024-10-07","title":"Why Odisha Governor Raghubar Das is facing BJD ire over Jharkhand polls","description":"Since the Assembly and Lok Sabha poll defeats, Naveen Patnaik’s party has been targeting Das over the assault allegations against his son. It has also accused him of nixing a pre-poll alliance with the BJP.","urlToImage":"https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/10/cover_02ab4d_20241006065958.jpg?w=640","content":"Among the prominent reasons that the Biju Janata Dal (BJD) cited for its defeat in the Assembly and Lok Sabha elections is the “role of the Odisha Governor” that, according to party insiders, is the trigger behind its ongoing tirade against Raghubar Das who entered the Raj Bhavan a year ago. Having already trained its guns on Das over his son allegedly assaulting a Raj Bhavan employee, the Naveen Patnaik-led party has fired a fresh salvo by alleging that the Raj Bhavan has been turned into a “war room” for the Jharkhand Assembly polls. The BJD on Thursday alleged the Governor’s office was being used for political manoeuvring in the neighbouring state. Das is Jharkhand’s first non-tribal Chief Minister, having served in the post from 2014 to 2019. He replaced Ganeshi Lal as Odisha Governor last October. While the Raj Bhavan did not comment on the BJD’s allegations, the BJP urged it to refrain from dragging the Raj Bhavan into politics. The BJD’s accusations come in the wake of visits by Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma and former Vice President and BJP veteran M Venkaiah Naidu to the Raj Bhavan in late September. Also read | What are the 5 promises BJP is betting on to power it to victory in Jharkhand? The office of the former Vice President has clarified that “no political colour should be attributed to (Naidu’s) visit to any part of the country in general, and to Bhubaneswar, Odisha recently, in particular”. An official statement said Naidu was in Bhubaneswar to attend a convocation as the chief guest in an appearance that was scheduled months ago. “Even as the Assam CM clarified (to the media) that his visit was for personal reasons, the incidents that followed, including Odisha CM Mohan Majhi’s visit to Jharkhand to meet Odia people, whose numbers are sizable there, proved that the Assam CM’s visit was for political reason,” said BJD Rajya Sabha MP Sulata Deo. Deo claimed there was “speculation” that Das might return to electoral politics and contest the coming Assembly elections in tribal-dominated Jharkhand. “We don’t bother whether he contests polls or not but the Odisha Raj Bhavan shouldn’t be made a political hub. The sanctity and dignity of the Raj Bhavan shouldn’t be demeaned,” said Deo, who addressed a press conference on this matter along with Rajya Sabha colleague Sasmit Patra. On the issue of Das’s son facing assault charges, the BJD said the government took no action despite assurances that it would act within 15 days. Even though the Raj Bhavan had no confrontation with the BJD government, unlike in other non-BJP ruled states, what caused disquiet in the Patnaik-led party were the district visits undertaken by Das immediately after taking over as the Governor. Das, 69, who is more politically savvy and active than Lal started touring all 30 districts and directly engaged with people at hospitals, schools and villages, which was considered uncommon for any Governor. After the visits, he also wrote to the CM on issues of governance. Though the regional party, while in power, chose not to react to the district tours, they created a flutter in the BJD camps as they coincided with frequent tours made by former bureaucrat and Patnaik aide V K Pandian.

BJD insiders said while the BJP’s central leadership had a “soft approach” towards the BJD before the polls and had never shown “much interest” in the Odisha Assembly elections, it was Das who apprised the BJP leadership of the anger among people about Pandian’s growing influence. The BJP subsequently decided to go guns blazing against the BJD based on the feedback Das provided, said a leader of the regional party. “The BJP’s central leadership had more concern for the Lok Sabha polls and didn’t bother much for the Assembly polls. At one point, the BJP leadership had also agreed on an alliance with the BJD despite the strong reservations of state BJP leaders. Das had a crucial role in persuading the BJP top brass not to ally with the BJD,” the BJD leader added. Since the poll defeat, Naveen Patnaik has taken a dig at the Governor on multiple occasions over the accusations against his son. In July, the former CM led the walkout by Opposition MLAs in the Assembly during the Governor’s customary speech to protest the inaction over the issue. In a reference to the accusations, Patnaik said while launching his party’s annual padayatra on Gandhi Jayanti that government employees were “not feeling safe even in the Raj Bhavan”.","category":"politics"},{"publishedAt":"2024-10-07","title":"In new land acquisition policy, BJP Rajasthan govt to offer ‘developed land’ instead of cash","description":"The policy is expected to be put in place through Rajasthan Aggregation of Private Land Bill 2024 to be brought in Assembly for passage before Rising Rajasthan Summit in order to “boost investor interest”","urlToImage":"https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/10/bhajan-Sharma-4colp.jpg?w=640","content":"The Bhajan Lal Sharma-led BJP government in Rajasthan has set the ball rolling for a land aggregation policy under which the government will acquire land from private landowners, develop it, and return at least 25% of it to the original landowners instead of giving cash compensation. The proposed policy, officials say, is likely to ease land acquisition for industrial, commercial, and residential purposes. The policy is expected to be put in place through the Rajasthan Aggregation of Private Land Bill 2024 to be brought in the Assembly for passage before the Rising Rajasthan Summit 2024 – the investment event scheduled to be held in Jaipur in December. Officials say the proposed law “will boost investor interest in the state”. Government sources say the value of land would go up once developed, making the deal more lucrative than one-time cash compensation. The original landowners will be free to use the land developed by the government for their own use, as well as rent it out or sell it in order to make maximum gains. “The return of 25% of developed land is estimated to be a better way of compensation since the value of a developed land will become multiple times higher once the project is implemented,” said an official. “Further, the designated use of the land will change by virtue of law to industrial, commercial, institutional or residential based on the project once it is aggregated under the proposed law, making its value rise considerably. Without acquisition under the proposed law, the original land will remain agricultural or residential, and the value is unlikely to rise as much,” he added. The official said the existing land acquisition law, under which the government takes over land in lieu of cash compensation, involves displacement that causes “psychological trauma”, impacts “livelihood”, and results in “potential conflicts of landowners with the government”. Under the proposed legislation, the Rajasthan government will set up The Land Aggregation and Development Authority — which would act as the authority for the aggregation of private land and its development. Sources said that a government department, corporation or board that is looking to acquire land will identify suitable private land and send their recommendations to the state government for its approval. A Land Aggregation Officer will be appointed under the proposed law to oversee the process. There will be a timeline for completing development work on the aggregated land to ensure timely availability of the developed land to landowners. Unless this is completed in five years, the land will go back to the Land Acquisition Authority. According to sources in the Rajasthan government’s industry department, Banswara – an underdeveloped district with a significant tribal population on the state’s border with Gujarat – as well as areas around the Delhi-Mumbai Industrial Corridor and the Delhi-Mumbai Expressway are expected to be among the prime beneficiaries of the proposed policy.","category":"politics"},{"publishedAt":"2024-10-07","title":"Why CPM in Kerala is in a bind over P Anvar’s allegations","description":"From accusing MLA of SDPI, Jamaat links to underlining CPM’s Malappuram “connection”, party tries to steady boat","urlToImage":"https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/10/Pinarayi-p.jpg?w=640","content":"In its attempts to counter the allegations raised by Independent legislator P V Anvar, who was till recently backed by the Left, the Kerala CPI(M)’s engagement with minority politics has taken a beating. Anvar has made a series of charges against the LDF government, including against Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan’s political secretary, asked why action was not being taken against ADGP Ajith Kumar for allegedly hobnobbing with the RSS, and also suggested that “RSS elements” had infiltrated the police force in Malappuram district and implicating “innocent people” in criminal cases. Muslim-dominated Malappuram district has seen a spate of gold seizures at Kozhikode airport. Anvar’s Nilampur constituency falls within the district. The state CPI(M), which remains firmly under the grip of Vijayan, has been seeking to woo the minorities towards its side, playing on their apprehensions regarding the BJP. The minorities in Kerala have largely been supporters of the Congress-led UDF. However, that the LDF’s gambit was not working was clear during the Lok Sabha elections, when the CPI(M)’s campaign that almost entirely revolved around the Citizenship (Amendment) Act failed to get it Muslim votes. Making it worse for the CPI(M), backward Hindus, traditionally its vote bank, too seemed to have deserted the party over its “appeasement of minorities”. Now the party is in a bind following Anvar’s allegations — including that ADGP Kumar “colluded” to help the BJP win the Thrissur Lok Sabha seat — which could further alienate the Muslim community from it. However, the CPI(M) remains unsure about how far it should push. The party has tried to be aggressive, alleging that Anvar was trying to stop police crackdown against gold smuggling. Both CPI(M) state secretary M V Govindan and Vijayan have said this, with the CM asserting that there was no question of stopping police action. However, this defence of the Vijayan government has taken a hit after an interview in The Hindu attributed remarks to him suggesting a communal tilt in the crackdown. The newspaper has since said that the remarks had been wrongly added, but the Opposition has latched on to them. IUML general secretary P K Kunhalikutty has said Vijayan’s statement was set to be used by the BJP to target the minorities. “The CM has served an issue to the Sangh Parivar. He has given it material to insult Malappuram district as well as Kerala,” he said. As damage-control, CPI(M) leaders have now started talking about how it was the party-led government of E M S Namboodiripad that formed the Malappuram district in 1969. Govindan has said the Congress and Sangh were together in opposing the formation of the district. “The RSS then said Kerala is going to have a mini-Pakistan. The CPI(M) strived for the growth of the district. It was the Communist government of 1957 that allowed construction of mosques like any other places of worship. We grew as a force in Malappuram district after fighting against all communal forces,” he said. Senior CPI(M) leader and LDF convenor T P Ramakrishnan on Saturday said there is a covert attempt to estrange minorities from the Left. “Our analysis has not so far come across that minorities are drifting away from the LDF. But there is a covert move to alienate the minorities from the Left and that will be countered,” he said. The CPI(M) has also strategically put forward its opinion that the Social Democratic Party of India, the political wing of the banned Popular Front of India, and the Jamaat-e-Islami are using Anvar as a weapon. This makes it difficult for the UDF to take Anvar on its platform, as the CPI(M) would cite it as proof that the Congress has joined hands with “communal elements”, a theme the Left used in the recent elections. Even though the CPI(M) is under fire from various Muslim organisations, both political and community, over the controversial reference to Malappuram, the party will observe October 7, the first anniversary of Israel’s invasion of Gaza, with protests in Kerala. The BJP, which is enjoying the CPI(M)’s discomfort, has asked the Vijayan government to clarify the truth on the gold seizures at Kozhikode airport. Claiming that the CM was trying to woo the Hindu vote without alienating Muslims, and that Hindus were “not convinced”, BJP state president K Surendran said: “If the figures of seized gold and money at Kozhikode airport are true, why is Vijayan worried?”","category":"politics"},{"publishedAt":"2024-10-07","title":"Today in Politics: As exit polls put Congress ahead in Haryana, party faces crucial decision – who will be its CM face?","description":"AAP national convenor and former CM Arvind Kejriwal is set to hold a second ‘Janta Ki Adalat’ rally in Delhi on Sunday","urlToImage":"https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/10/cats_3aefb2.jpg?w=640","content":"As polling concluded in Haryana on Saturday, exit polls suggested the Congress would return to power in Haryana after 10 years of BJP rule.

The front-runner in this race is the Leader of the Opposition in the outgoing Assembly, Bhupinder Singh Hooda as reported by Varinder Bhatia. A two-time CM from 2005 till 2014, Hooda also spearheaded the party’s campaign in the Assembly polls and in the recent Lok Sabha elections. His bete noire and Sirsa MP Kumari Selja, the All India Congress Committee (AICC) general secretary and ex-Union minister, is also being seen as a major contender for the CM’s post.

Whoever is chosen as the Congress Legislature Party (CLP) leader is generally considered to be the party high command’s choice for the CM’s post. The final decision is taken by the high command and everybody will accept it, irrespective of their ambitions.” The picture is less clear in Jammu and Kashmir, where Assembly elections were held after 10 years – the first after the abrogation of Article 370 in 2019.

The BJP MPs have claimed that the PAC’s move to announce an inquiry against SEBI is in violation of rules. Senior BJP leader and PAC member Nishikant Dubey wrote to the Speaker last month, claiming that the PAC’s move would “destabilise the country’s financial structure and economy”. “While performing the functions of Chairman, Public Accounts Committee, Mr. K.C. Venugopal has, thus, committed an unconstitutional and disdainful act of announcing an inquiry against the SEBI Chief by the Committee (PAC), which is against the Constitutional provisions and in clear violation of Rule 308 of the Rules of Procedure and Conduct of Business. I request your goodself to restrain Mr. K.C. Venugopal not to play at the hands of the aforementioned ‘tool kit’ and misuse his position as Chairman of the Public Accounts Committee,” Dubey wrote to Birla. The PAC on Friday finalised its agenda for its next meeting on October 24. The agenda stated: “Briefing by Audit followed by Oral evidence of the representatives of Ministry of Finance (Department of Economic Affairs) and Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) on the subject, ‘Performance Review of Regulatory Bodies established by Act of Parliament’. Oral evidence of the representatives of the Ministry of Communications, Department of Telecommunications and Telecom Regulatory Authority of India on the subject, ‘Performance Review of Regulatory Bodies established by Act of Parliament’.” Sources said the PAC has so far not received a confirmation from SEBI on whether Buch, who has been accused of professional impropriety by US-based firm Hindenburg Research, would attend the meeting herself or send a representative. Dubey wrote the letter on September 9 after the PAC suo motu decided to review the performance of SEBI. The BJP MPs in the panel cited rules to say that the panel did not have the powers to review the performance of the regulatory board as the CAG could not audit it unless the Central government permitted it. Now that the PAC has asked Buch and other officials to appear before it on October 24, sources said the ruling party MPs will approach the Speaker for his intervention against it. Dubey in his letter alleged that Venugopal was “handpicked by the Congress to devise ways and means even by misusing his authority” and he is now trying to “to rake up those issues which are non-existent, with the sole intention of defaming the government and destabilising the financial structure and the economy”. The BJP MP argued that the functions of the PAC, as per the rules of the Rules of Procedure and Conduct of Business in Lok Sabha, include examination of accounts showing the appropriation of sums granted by Parliament for the expenditure of the Government of India, the Annual Finance Accounts of the government and such other accounts laid before the House as the committee may think fit. On the basis of the rules, the committee has to satisfy that the money shown in the accounts of the government as the money disbursed by it are legally available for the services or purposes to which they have been charged, that the expenditure conforms to the authority which governs it and that every re-appropriation has been made in accordance with the provisions framed by competent authority. Dubey argued that the “sole function of the PAC is confined to scrutinising the Appropriation Accounts of the government of India and the CAG reports”. The BJP MP said the CAG has not published any report on the conduct of SEBI chief nor the current charges have any linkage to the Appropriation Accounts of the Indian government. “Therefore, now the question arises as to what are the compelling reasons on the basis of which Mr. K.C.Venugopal, in the capacity of Chairman of Public Accounts Committee, has announced an unconstitutional, illegal and highly deplorable act to investigate the allegation of ‘conflict of interest’ of Mrs. Madhabi Puri Buch, SEBI Chief by the Public Accounts Committee…,” he wrote in his letter.","category":"politics"},{"publishedAt":"2024-10-07","title":"‘Julana mange gold’: Vinesh Phogat supporters eye a big win, flag her protest, Olympic blow","description":"Julana saw a high turnout where the wrestler and Cong candidate is caught in a fight with BJP’s Captain Yogesh Kumar and JJP’s sitting MLA Amardeep Dhanda","urlToImage":"https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/10/women-vp.jpg?w=640","content":"On Saturday afternoon, Chap Singh Rathee, the sarpanch of Bakhta Khera in the Julana Assembly seat in Haryana’s Jind district, is busy bringing voters to the polling booth. Assisting an old and frail woman as she gets onto a motorcycle, he says: “We have 1,800 voters in this village, and 1,400 have already voted by 3 pm. This has surpassed the Lok Sabha poll figure. Vinesh is our girl, everyone from every biradari is voting for her.” Julana is the constituency from where wrestler Vinesh Phogat is making her poll debut on the Congress ticket. She is pitted against the BJP’s Captain Yogesh Kumar and the Jannayak Janata Party (JJP)’s sitting MLA Amardeep Dhanda. Baktha Khera is Vinesh’s husband Somvir Rathee’s village. While Haryana recorded a turnout of 61.25% by 7 pm Saturday, Julana saw a turnout of 69.8%. Across Baktha Khera, many are going out of their way to ensure the victory of their “bahu (daughter-in-law) Vinesh” amid a slogan in the village, “Julana mange gold (Julana wants gold)”. Sarpanch Rathee takes a break and sits down with the elders. As a hookah is passed among them, they discuss the portfolios Vinesh might be given in the event of her victory and that of the Congress. “We have been promised that she will be the sports minister. I am sure she will get another portfolio, too,” Rathee says. A few hundred metres away, returning from the voting booth, Sudesh Kumari, 47, says, “She (Vinesh) is our Jhansi ki Rani. She listens to us and will work for us. She is setting an example for the girls in our villages.” Around 15 km away, in a village called Shamlo Kalan, 50-year-old Sheela Satpal, says Vinesh will help other girls move ahead. “If she sets up institutions in our village, our girls wouldn’t have to go out for education and jobs. You might have seen what happened at Jantar Mantar (the protest against former MP and Wrestling Federation of India president Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh), so we need to support her. Vinesh jeetegi hi jeetegi (Vinesh is going to win),” she says. Julana was held by the Indian National Lok Dal (INLD) from 2009 to 2019. The JJP’s Amarjeet Dhanda won it in the 2019 polls, when the party emerged as the kingmaker in forming the government and allied with the BJP. This move, many say, has led to many of its voters drift away from the JJP. This is apparent in Ramkali, a predominantly Jat village, which had largely voted for the JJP in 2019. “We were staunch Chautala voters, but JJP chief Dushyant (Chautala) went and sided with Modi. They beat up our wrestlers and farmers. The whole village this time voted for the Congress,” Kitabo, 60, says. Also read | Wrestler-turned-politician Vinesh Phogat: ‘Brij Bhushan is surviving because of political power … we also have to be powerful’ Her son Chandgi, 24, says, “Vinesh will work for us, listen to us.” Kitabo interrupts him, saying: “Even if she doesn’t, we’ll still support her.” A lab attendant, Pankaj Mor, who is also from Ramkali says, “There is also sympathy for her (Vinesh). She has only seen hardships. Her father died when she was young. She worked hard to be a wrestler and Brij Bhushan made her career difficult. When she protested, they dragged her on Delhi roads. Even at the Olympics, she didn’t get the silver she deserved.” He adds, “We wanted her to contest and we will make her win,” and proceeds to signal at an old man wearing a shirt that reads: ‘Desh ki shaan, Vinesh pehelwan (India’s pride, Vinesh wrestler)”. At the local mandi, Sunil Aggarwal, 50, who owns a jute sack manufacturing unit, speaks of the Jat reservation agitation in 2016. “Under the Congress, there are unequal opportunities. This favouritism resulted in the BJP coming to power. We vote for the party because they take everyone along,” he says. In Opinions | Between Vinesh Phogat and Gurmeet Ram Rahim, what it means to be a woman voter in a deeply patriarchal society Aggarwal is quick to add that it is good to see Vinesh in politics. “But we look at the party more than the candidate,” he says. In the Jind town, Parveen, 40, a councillor, says Vinesh is “immensely popular” with women. “She said she would improve the transport facilities for girl children. Women know that a woman leader will be able to focus on them and understand what their needs are,” she says. However, she adds, Vinesh had refused to eat at people’s houses. “She had bouncers, too. It might reduce the margin we initially thought of.” In Bishanpura, with 30% of voters being Yadavs, the village supports the BJP, says Naresh Yadav, its sarpanch. “Yogesh will get all non-Jat votes. Recently, there was a congregation of OBC and SC voters who vowed to vote en masse for BJP,” he claims. Some voters say they are sticking to the BJP due to the party-led incumbent government’s welfare programmes. Mukesh, a landless labourer from the Dalit community, says she gave her vote to “(PM Narendra) Modi” who “has given us ration”.","category":"politics"},{"publishedAt":"2024-10-07","title":"Flagging SCO meet, Mirwaiz urges India, Pak to ‘break ice’ and engage over Kashmir","description":"Earlier, in his Friday sermon, Hurriyat chief calls for return of Kashmiri Pandits to Valley, says Assembly polls would not be “a way forward to resolve Kashmir issue”","urlToImage":"https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/10/Untitled-design-3-2.jpg?w=640","content":"Hurriyat Conference chairman Mirwaiz Umar Farooq said Saturday that the meeting of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO)’s Council of Heads of Government, scheduled for October 15-16 in Islamabad, would be a “real opportunity” for India and Pakistan to “break the ice and engage constructively”. In his first tweet since August 2019 – when the Centre abrogated Article 370 granting special status to Jammu and Kashmir – Mirwaiz stated: “Despite increased challenges, the resolve for peaceful resolution of conflict remains stronger than ever. Generations of Kashmiris have been consumed by the uncertainty. We want an end to it, a fair closure.” In his tweet, the Hurriyat chief said: “India and Pakistan have a real opportunity at the upcoming SCO Summit to break the ice and engage constructively,” adding “Hope they heed to it”. External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar will lead the Indian delegation to Pakistan for the SCO meeting. This will be the first visit to Pakistan by India’s External Affairs Minister in nine years. In his post on X, Mirwaiz said that after more than five years, mostly spent under house detention, “I return to this platform with the same hope of peace and justice for the people of Jammu and Kashmir that I have always desired”. Mirwaiz was also allowed to give the Friday sermon at Srinagar’s historic Jamia Masjid for the first time since September 2.

Mirwaiz, who is also the Valley’s head priest, said the “return of Kashmiri Pandits to the Valley is a humanitarian issue” and that the Muslim majority of the Valley has a role to play in their return. “I have time and again said from this pulpit (Jamia Masjid) that the issue of Kashmiri Pandits is also a human issue. Whether the government does something or not, as a majority, as Muslims we have to work for it, we have to get them back…” he said. He also said, “I want to tell them (Kashmiri Pandits) that your saviour, your guardian is the Muslims of Kashmir… There are wounds on both sides, don’t peel them, try to heal them so that we think of the future. But we can talk of the future only when our uncertain future is resolved.” Also Read | Jaishankar to visit Pakistan for SCO meeting: What is the organisation — and what is its significance? On the current Assembly elections in J&K being held after a gap of 10 years, Mirwaiz said during his sermon that while it may “give some relief to the people”, it would not be “a way forward to resolve the Kashmir issue”. “We also believe that civic elections for governance are no means to resolve this matter (J&K issue) and do not represent people’s aspirations and sentiments with regard to the conflict. These are two different things. Anyway, civic elections in a Union Territory are limited in giving any real power to its residents. In J&K, it (elections) was rendered almost meaningless after further amendments made to the Reorganisation Act giving further sweeping executive powers to the Lieutenant Governor,” the Hurriyat chairman said. Hitting out at regional mainstream political parties for “failing to put a united flight”, Mirwaiz said, “It is unfortunate that at this crucial juncture the regional political organisations and individuals who contested could not come together and jointly fight for the great challenges before people”. He said he hoped that “these political parties and individuals will rise to the occasion and collectively prioritise people’s interest rather than personal and party interests”.","category":"politics"},{"publishedAt":"2024-10-07","title":"Congress likely to win Haryana, its alliance with NC has edge in J-K: Exit polls","description":"The exit polls showed two broad trends -- the near decimation of the PDP, and the BJP managing to hold on to its seats in the Jammu region.","urlToImage":"https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/10/haryana-congress.jpg?w=640","content":"The Congress is likely to return to power in Haryana after a decade, and has an edge but may miss the halfway mark in Jammu and Kashmir, where it fought the Assembly elections in alliance with the National Conference, according to most exit polls on Saturday. In J&K, where Assembly elections were held after 10 years — the first after the abrogation of Article 370 in 2019 — some polls predicted a hung House while others gave a narrow lead to the Congress-NC alliance. The exit polls showed two broad trends — the near decimation of the PDP, and the BJP managing to hold on to its seats in the Jammu region. With 90 Assembly constituencies this time, the India Today-C Voter poll put the Congress-NC at near the halfway mark. It gave 40-48 seats to the Congress-NC, 27-32 to the BJP, 6-12 to the PDP, and 6-11 to ‘Others’. What pollsters said about Haryana electionsThe Dainik Bhaskar exit poll predicted 35-40 seats for the Congress-NC, 20-25 for the BJP, 4-7 for the PDP, and 12-18 for ‘Others’. Axis My India put the figures at 35-45 for the Congress-NC, 24-34 for the BJP, 4-6 for PDP and 8-23 for ‘Others’. A poll by Gulistan News gave 31-36 seats to the Congress-NC alliance, 28-30 to the BJP, 5-7 to the PDP, and 19-23 to ‘Others’. People’s Pulse gave the Congress-NC 46-50 and the BJP 23-27. The trends suggest a decent performance for the BJP in Jammu, as the party is traditionally weak in the Kashmir valley. In the 2014 J&K Assembly elections, before the state was split into two Union Territories, the PDP had won 28 seats, BJP 25, NC 15 and Congress 12. The hung poll verdict led to the PDP-BJP forming a coalition government, but the BJP pulled the plug in June 2018. In the Lok Sabha elections earlier this year, two J&K seats went to the NC, two to the BJP, and one to an Independent. What pollsters said about Jammu and Kashmir elections The poll scene got muddied this time with the entry of an unusually large number of Independents — as many as 365 filed their nominations and, along with the smaller parties, People’s Conference, Apni Party and Awami Ittehad Party (AIP) of the recently-released-on-bail Engineer Rashid, they added up to 45 per cent of the contestants in J&K. According to the Congress-NC seat-sharing arrangement, the Congress contested 32 seats while the NC fielded 51 candidates. The two parties were in friendly contests in five seats, and left one seat each for the CPI(M)’s M Y Tarigami, and National Panthers Party-India’s Harsh Dev Singh. The overall turnout in J&K, which went to polls in three phases (on September 18, September 24 and October 1) was 63.88%. While the turnout was 65.52 per cent in the 2014 Assembly elections, it was 58.46 per cent in the Lok Sabha elections earlier this year. In Haryana, which saw 61.19 per cent polling on Saturday – the turnout was 68.31 per cent in the 2019 Assembly elections – all the exit polls predicted a lead or comfortable win for the Congress in the 90-member House. The Dainik Bhaskar poll predicted 44-54 seats for the Congress, 15-29 for the BJP, 0-1 for the JJP, 1-5 for the INLD, and 0-1 for the AAP. The Republic Bharat-Matrize poll gave 55-62 seats to the Congress, 18-24 to the BJP, 0-3 to the JJP, 3-6 to the INLD and none for the AAP. The India Today-C Voter poll gave 50-58 seats to the Congress, 20-28 to the BJP, and 10-16 to ‘Others’ including the INLD and JJP. Axis My India gave the Congress 53-65 seats, and the BJP 18-28. In the 2019 Haryana Assembly elections, the BJP had won 40 seats, Congress 31, JJP 10, INLD 1, Haryana Lokhit Party 1, and Independent 7. In the Lok Sabha elections earlier this year, 5 of the state’s seats went to the Congress and another five to the BJP. In 2019, the BJP had swept all the 10 Lok Sabha seats from the state. Eyeing a third term in power, the BJP had replaced Manohar Lal Khattar with Nayab Singh Saini as Chief Minister earlier this year. The Congress and AAP, both INDIA bloc allies, failed to reach a seat-sharing agreement and went to polls separately. Dushyant Chautala’s Jannayak Janta Party, earlier a BJP ally, fielded candidates in alliance with Chandershekar Azad’s Azad Samaj Party (Kanshi Ram), while Abhay Chautala-led INLD joined hands with Mayawati’s BSP.

Apart from being a prominent Dalit face, she is also known for her proximity with the Gandhis. “The Congress cannot rule out my vast experience and my unquestionable loyalty towards the party. Selja is a loyal soldier of the Congress and will always remain with the Congress. Everybody knows the decision about who will be the Congress CM is always taken by the party high command,” says Selja, 62. There is also a buzz in the Congress circles that if Hooda bows out of the CM race, his son and Rohtak MP, Deepender Hooda, would emerge as a “formidable claimant” for the CM’s chair. LIVE | Haryana Exit Poll Results 2024 Live Updates: Congress sweep in Haryana, BJP to miss hat-trick On Selja’s bid to flag her “seniority” and “loyalty” to reinforce her CM bid, Deepender says, “Whatever she (Selja) has said, there is nothing wrong in it. There is a proper procedure in Congress. The first priority is for the party to get a majority and form the government. A meeting takes place at the level of party high command, the elected MLAs are consulted and the final decision is taken by the party high command.” Also Read | Haryana Assembly elections: Gurgaon sees 57% turnout, 72% in Nuh In all his poll rallies across the state though, Deepender maintained that “The BJP government is on its way out in Haryana – and the Congress is going to form its government under Bhupinder Singh Hooda’s leadership.” After casting his vote in his home turf, Kaithal, on Saturday, Rajya Sabha MP and AICC general secretary Randeep Singh Surjewala stuck to his cautious line, saying “Having the CM ambition is not wrong. We will accept the decision taken by Rahul Gandhi and Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge for CM face”. Surjewala, 57, is considered by his aides as a “dark horse” in the race. Party sources say the state Congress chief and Dalit leader Udai Bhan, a known Hooda loyalist, is also one of the CM aspirants. Sources told The Indian Express that in one of the meetings with the AICC leaders in Delhi, Bhan had also staked his claim if the party would name a Dalit face as the CM.

While both Hooda and Deepender campaigned intensely along with Bhan across Haryana, Selja and Surjewala divided their time between Haryana and Delhi in this period. For the Lok Sabha polls, Hooda had campaigned across eight Lok Sabha seats for the Congress candidates and in Kurukshetra for the then ally AAP’s nominee, but had stayed away from Sirsa, Selja’s constituency. On its part, the incumbent BJP has been hitting out at the Congress for “factionalism and infighting” within its ranks.

Hooda also got the lion’s share in ticket distribution, getting the candidates of his choice in 72 seats. A senior Congress leader told The Indian Express, “Claimants can be many, but what matters is who do the elected MLAs want as their leader. Whoever is chosen as the Congress Legislature Party (CLP) leader is generally considered to be the party high command’s choice for the CM’s post. The final decision is taken by the high command and everybody will accept it, irrespective of their ambitions.” Another senior Congress leader said, “The party high command is also known to come up with surprises like what happened in the 2005 polls. The party had then won 67 seats and Bhajan Lal was set to be the CM. But, at the last moment Bhupinder Hooda’s name was declared as the CM. Anything can happen, but one thing is sure: Hooda is not Bhajan Lal and the high command also knows it.”","category":"politics"},{"publishedAt":"2024-10-07","title":"Behind Centre’s nod for Chennai Metro II, signal to NDA allies and DMK","description":"The Cabinet clearance on Thursday was welcomed by the DMK-led Tamil Nadu government, with CM Stalin thanking PM Modi for it.","urlToImage":"https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/10/bjp-tamil-nadu.jpg?w=640","content":"The Union Cabinet’s move to approve Phase II of the Chennai Metro Rail project on Thursday and clear the Central counterpart funding came less than a week after Tamil Nadu Chief Minister M K Stalin met Prime Minister Narendra Modi on September 27 . The Centre’s decision will facilitate a smooth execution of the 118.9-km long lines under Phase II with 128 stations at a total cost of Rs 63,246 crore. The Centre’s own contribution for the Phase II will be Rs 7,425 crore. The stalling of clearance was largely for political reasons. The foundation stone for the project was laid by Union Home Minister Amit Shah almost four years ago in November 2020; the Central counterpart funding was announced in Budget 2021-22 itself, and Central spending for the project was approved by the Union Finance Ministry’s Public Investment Board more than three years ago in August 2021. For almost three years since PIB clearance, the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs did not clear it. The non-participation of the Centre so far had left the state in a difficult financial position, since it had already announced Phase II of the project and had to politically go ahead . Tamil Nadu had to take it forward as a state sector project instead of the originally planned joint sector project. For over three years, the Centre’s delay in funding the Chennai Metro Phase-II had been a sore point between the BJP and the DMK, with the latter calling it a clear case of alleged bias against the Opposition-ruled states, particularly Tamil Nadu. The Cabinet clearance on Thursday was welcomed by the DMK-led Tamil Nadu government, with CM Stalin thanking PM Modi for it. Clearly, the Modi government’s move appears to resolve a prolonged standoff between the Centre and Tamil Nadu, but also conveys a deeper political message aimed at not only the DMK— a key constituent of the INDIA alliance — but also the BJP’s own NDA allies at the national level. Don't miss | How Udhayanidhi Stalin, new TN Deputy CM, rose through DMK ranks BJP leaders now say the decision not only lowers the party and the Central government’s tension with the DMK dispensation but also keeps the party’s “increasingly demanding” NDA allies in check. Stalin thanked PM Modi for “accepting our request during my last meeting with you” and for addressing “this long-pending demand” of the Tamil Nadu people. In state political circles, the DMK chief’s reaction was perceived as “showing unusual warmth” towards Modi. A state RSS leader called the Centre’s move “strategic” which, he said, was meant to show the BJP as being “cooperative, even with the Opposition-ruled states”. “With JD(U) chief Nitish Kumar and TDP president Chandrababu Naidu becoming more demanding, this would help to create cordial relations with DMK while signalling to NDA allies that we have friends, even in INDIA bloc, and that we can accommodate everyone’s demands,” the leader said. The Modi government depends critically on both the TDP and the JD(U) as the BJP fell short of the majority mark of 272 in the recent Lok Sabha elections, winning 240 seats. The TDP and the JD(U) got 16 and 12 seats respectively. DMK leader T K S Elangovan told the media that the Modi government’s decision is “happy news” for not only the DMK dispensation but also the people of the state. A senior DMK minister underlined the efforts the DMK had made to get the Centre approve the release of its share in the Chennai Metro II project. “After CM Stalin visited Delhi, state BJP president Annamalai’s tweet two days ago was the first clear indication that they (Centre) are positive. It is evident that the decision had already been made, and Annamalai was likely asked to post the tweet,” the minister told The Indian Express. “There’s a marked difference between what Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said in Chennai two weeks ago, and Annamalai’s tweet—it was a reversal in tone and stance. The over Rs 7,000 crore we are receiving from the NDA government is acceptable even for our ally Congress, as this release was purely procedural. And the delay was entirely political,” the minister said. Three days after Stalin’s meeting with PM Modi, Annamalai, who is currently attending an academic programme abroad, urged the Centre, in a post on X, to fund the project. “Considering the significant delay in the project’s execution, on behalf of BJP Tamil Nadu and the people of Tamil Nadu, we urgently request that the Central Government kindly consider infusing 50% equity for Phase 2 of the Chennai Metro Rail Project to help complete the project as soon as possible,” he stated. ExplainedSeen as politically strategicThe Cabinet’s clearance after a delay of over three years is seen as politically strategic since it will help smoothen BJP-DMK and Centre-state relations. This also gives a signal to NDA allies, who are seen as “increasingly demanding” by some in the BJP. Sitharaman had last month said in Chennai that because the Tamil Nadu government had decided to implement the Chennai Metro Rail Phase II as a state sector project, its entire cost should be borne by the state. She also asserted that the Union Budget does not ignore any state, debunking any other narratives made by the Opposition. The DMK leaders had earlier alleged that the Centre’s delay in funding Chennai Metro II was “politically motivated”, citing funding disparities for the Metro projects between Chennai and smaller cities like Kanpur and Surat, which, they said, got the funds from the Centre in 2022-23 and 2023-24. The Centre’s decision now is seen by some state leaders as a “truce” between the two camps. On Friday, Governor R N Ravi also shared the stage with Deputy CM Udhayanidhi Stalin at an event. When asked about this, a senior DMK leader said: “Look at the Governor’s statements. He has changed now as compared to days before the recent Lok Sabha polls.” Also in Political Pulse | Marital rape: While Centre says don’t criminalise, Opposition leaders have been pushing for it After the Lok Sabha elections, which saw the DMK-led alliance sweep the state by winning all 39 seats, Annamalai has also refrained from targeting the DMK on various issues. There is a perception in state political circles that the “truce serves both parties well”. “While BJP faces tough elections in key states like Maharashtra and Haryana, and Mamata Banerjee remains a formidable foe, keeping relations with DMK amicable allows BJP to maintain the appearance of having no die-hard enemies even within the INDIA alliance,” said an observer. A state BJP leader said Stalin has “played his cards carefully by personally meeting Modi with a request for funds”. “But if you call it a truce, I call it a win-win for both sides,” he said. Another senior BJP leader said: “Of course, we are trying to manage our allies, and by releasing these funds, it shows that Delhi is willing to work with states, even Opposition-led ones, when it serves its interest.” The DMK camp however dismissed the possibility of having any alliance with the BJP. “Such a partnership is a fantasy — it would collapse at the ground level. This isn’t the 1990s when we had a tie-up,” said a party leader.","category":"politics"},{"publishedAt":"2024-10-07","title":"How close were past exit polls in Haryana and J-K?","description":"While most got 2014 largely right in the two states, almost no exit poll predicted the tight contest in the 2019 Haryana Assembly elections","urlToImage":"https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/10/ch1887922_4129ce.jpg?w=640","content":"As voting in Haryana concludes on Saturday, all eyes will now turn to the exit polls ahead of the results on October 8. In Haryana, while the exit polls in 2014 were largely accurate in predicting the BJP’s win, they were well off the mark in 2019 when many pollsters had expected a landslide BJP win rather than a hung House. In Jammu and Kashmir, which last held an Assembly election in 2014, exit polls had predicted a hung Assembly while giving the edge to the Peoples Democratic Party, ahead of the BJP, National Conference and Congress. Haryana In 2014, the BJP came to power ending the Congress’s 10-year run. An average of four exit polls had predicted the BJP would just fall short of the 46-seat majority mark in the 90-seat Assembly. While the BJP was projected to win an average of 43 seats across these polls, the Indian National Lok Dal (INLD) was predicted to finish as the runner-up with 27 seats, followed by the Congress at 13. The polls were just short of the mark for the BJP and Congress, which won 47 and 15 seats, respectively. Pollsters, however, were on average off by eight seats for the INLD, which ended up with 19 seats. Two polls predicted the BJP would cross the majority mark that year – News 24-Chanakya and ABP News-Nielsen. Times Now and India TV-CVoter correctly predicted the Congress’s tally while News24-Chanakya was the closest to the INLD’s final score. [CHART: 2014 HARYANA] In 2019, however, most polls predicted a thumping BJP victory with some projecting wins in more than 70 seats. But the election ended in a hung Assembly, with all parties failing to cross the majority mark. An average of eight exit polls put the BJP’s estimated tally at 61 seats, with the Congress trailing far behind at 18. However, the BJP ended up with just 40 seats and the Congress with 31. On average, these polls overestimated the BJP’s performance by 21 seats and underestimated the Congress’s tally by 13 seats. Seven of these polls projected the BJP would alone hit the majority mark. While NewsX-Pollstrat predicted the BJP would win in as many as 75-80 seats, only India Today-Axis said it would win 32-44 seats and fall short of a majority. Only three polls predicted the Congress would clear the 20-seat mark and just one said it would cross 30 seats. India Today-Axis’s projection of 30-42 for the Congress was the most accurate. [CHART: 2019 HARYANA]Jammu and Kashmir In 2014, the last time J&K held an Assembly election, the CVoter exit poll had predicted that no party would clear the 44-seat majority mark in the then 87-member House.

In the end, the PDP won 28 seats, the BJP 25, the NC 15, and the Congress 12.","category":"politics"},{"publishedAt":"2024-10-07","title":"Marital rape: While Centre says don’t criminalise, Opposition leaders have been pushing for it","description":"CPM’s Brinda Karat says Centre effectively saying “woman’s body is not her own but husband’s”, TMC’s Derek O’Brien had earlier moved a private member’s Bill seeking to criminalise marital rape","urlToImage":"https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/10/ch1778335_e582c9.jpg?w=640","content":"The Centre on Thursday told the Supreme Court there was no need to criminalise marital rape as there are other “suitably designed punitive measures”. While this is a longstanding stance of the BJP and its ideological parent, the RSS, most Opposition parties over the years have either argued for criminalisation of marital rape or sought a review of the exception given to it under the law. The Congress, Left, Trinamool Congress (TMC), DMK, Shiv Sena (UBT), Samajwadi Party (SP), RJD, Bharat Rashtra Samithi (BRS) and Biju Janata Dal (BJD), among others, have from time to time argued for legislation on marital rape as a crime. On Friday, speaking to The Indian Express, CPI(M) leader Brinda Karat described the government submission in the Supreme Court as “regressive”. “It is retrograde and regressive because it essentially sees a woman’s body as part of a marriage contract in which the husband has full rights over her body. This is essentially what the government’s statement means despite all the ifs and buts it has added to it. It is saying a woman’s body is not her own but her husband’s,” Karat said. The Congress’s Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury, who had earlier batted for criminalisation of marital rape, was more measured. “The issue is sensitive. It has to be dealt with very comprehensively. Opinions of all stakeholders should be taken so that a comprehensive view can be taken. It is very difficult to differentiate what is marital rape and what is conjugal cohabitation. It is a delicate matter. It should be left to the judiciary to take a call. It needs a wide discussion among all sections of the society. We are a diverse culture,” Chowdhury told The Indian Express. The statement is a slight departure from the stance that Chowdhury took in his dissent note in the Parliamentary Standing Committee report published last year on the three new criminal laws to replace the Indian Penal Code (IPC), the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) and the Indian Evidence Act. Flagging deficiencies in the proposed laws, Chowdhury had written, “Despite claiming that the new Bills were drafted keeping in mind the issue of women’s safety, the government continues to exempt acts of marital rape from ambit of rape laws. The recognition of marital rape as an offence has been a longstanding demand from Indian women across the board.” The stand taken by Chowdhury had been repeated verbatim by other Congress members of the committee, including Rajya Sabha MPs Digvijaya Singh and Ravneet Singh. TMC Rajya Sabha MP Derek O’Brien had in 2022 even introduced a private member’s Bill seeking to criminalise marital rape. He had argued that any exception to the definition of rape is antithetical to the right to life and liberty, and that all women have the right to lead a safe and dignified life. In his dissent note in the Parliamentary Standing Committee report on the three criminal laws, O’Brien had said, “The colonial laws did not recognise men and women as equals and merged the identity of women with their husbands. The Bharatiya Sakshya Bill does not make any significant changes to the ‘colonial’ Indian Evidence Act, even though the Law Commission report of 2003 had suggested so many changes in the form of amendment and substitution of provisions.” In 2015, DMK MP Kanimozhi had raised the issue in the Rajya Sabha. Citing a United Nations Population Fund report, she had said more than 75% of the married women in India were victims of marital rape and that there were no laws in India to deal with the problem. In the 167th report of the Standing Committee on the Ministry of Home Affairs, which examined the Criminal Law Amendment Bill, 2012, the CPI’s D Raja had said, “Both the Ordinance and the Standing Committee exempt marital rape from being considered a crime under Section 375 of the Indian Penal Code. This is contrary to the provisions of the Indian Constitution, which considers all women as equal human beings who have a right to live with dignity and free from violence within and outside marriage.” Raja pointed out that this was also contrary to the Verma Committee report, which had pointed out that the “exemption for marital rape stems from a long outdated notion of marriage, which regarded wives as no more than the property of their husbands … whereas marriage is in modern times regarded as a partnership of equals”. In March 2021, the then undivided NCP’s Rajya MP Vandana Chavan raised the issue of marital rape during Zero Hour in Parliament. Chavan argued that for decades there have been demands from several quarters asking that marital rape be made a criminal offence. “After the lockdown, especially, we have seen that these instances have increased, and, in fact, the seriousness also amplified to a great extent,” she said. Stating that Parliament had always taken proactive steps towards the protection of women, she said: “… why then are we not treating marital rape as an offence?… The Justice Verma Committee recommended the same. More than a hundred countries in the world have made marital rape an offence and we fall only among the 36 countries that have not.” Chavan also called the government’s argument that it would destabilise the institution of marriage “absurd”. “When a husband beats his wife or subjects her to mental or physical cruelty, it is an offence. So, if he forcibly sexually abuses her, does this not amount to an offence? So, this is an absurd argument,” she said. The SP’s Jaya Bachchan, Shiv Sena’s Priyanka Chaturvedi, RJD’s Manoj Jha, Aam Aadmi Party’s Narayan Das Gupta, BRS’s Banda Prakash, DMK’s P Wilson, Congress’s Chhaya Verma, and BJD’s Amar Patnaik, Bhaskar Rao Nekkanti and Sasmit Patra have all been associated with the cause.","category":"politics"},{"publishedAt":"2024-10-07","title":"Today in Politics: As Haryana votes today, will turnout be higher than last time’s 68.31%?","description":"Plus, PM to LoP Rahul Gandhi turn to next state in line for polls: Maharashtra","urlToImage":"https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/10/today-in-politics.jpg?w=640","content":"As Haryana votes Saturday, the big question is whether the Congress has managed to seize on the anti-incumbency in the state against the two-time BJP government. The Congress seems upbeat and appears to be ahead in the perception battle across the state. However, as Liz Mathew reported, the BJP might not yet be completely out of the picture. Mathew, who travelled through the Kurukshetra-Karnal region, writes that the BJP, sensing that livelihood issues will matter to voters more than anything else, had adjusted its strategy. It focussed on the state government’s track record over the past decade rather than solely relying on the image and popularity of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. It is the first time in a decade that the PM was not front and centre in an election campaign by the BJP. On the campaign trail, the party spoke of creating jobs transparently — “bina parchi, bina kharchi (jobs without recommendations or bribes)” — the Saini administration’s decision to increase the annual income limit for the creamy layer among Other Backward Classes (OBCs) from Rs 6 lakh to Rs 8 lakh, and a host of sops announced for government employees, backward communities, and panchayat chiefs. With the issue of unemployment having dented the BJP in the Lok Sabha elections in Haryana a few months ago — the party lost five of the 10 parliamentary seats to the Congress — BJP workers also talked about the Saini government’s efforts to create jobs. This, they believe, will blunt the Congress’s narrative on joblessness. The Congress seems confident of a win, with senior leaders Bhupinder Singh Hooda and Kumari Selja lining up to be in the running for the CM race. In 2019, Haryana saw a fractured mandate, with the BJP winning 40 seats, six less than the 46-seat majority mark in the 90-member House. The Congress bagged 31 seats, the JJP 10, and the INLD one. The JJP proved to be the kingmaker, striking an alliance with the BJP to form a coalition government. The results for the Haryana polls will be out on October 8, along with that of J&K.

Maharashtra Governor C P Radhakrishnan, Union Ministers Shivraj Singh Chouhan and Rajiv Ranjan Singh, Chief Minister Eknath Shinde, and Deputy Chief Ministers Ajit Pawar and Devendra Fadnavis will attend the event. Maharashtra farmers will receive an additional Rs 2,000 crore under the state’s Namo Shetkari Mahasanman Nidhi Yojana, an official statement said. On Saturday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi will be visiting the state for the second time within a fortnight, making halts in the politically crucial region of Vidarbha. The trip will include a tour of the Jagdamba Mata Temple, Poharadevi, in Washim, an important pilgrimage centre of the Banjara community, halts at samadhis of two local saints, and the inauguration of a ‘Banjara Virasat Museum’ A nomadic tribe, the Banjaras number over a crore, constituting a sizeable vote bank in parts of Vidarbha, North Maharashtra and Marathwada regions. The BJP’s push for the Banjara vote follows the erosion of support for it among the Dalits and Kunbis.

Of the three parties in the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA), the Congress performed the best in the Lok Sabha elections, winning 13 of the 17 parliamentary seats it contested. In the party, a lot of credit has been given to the All India Congress Committee’s (AICC) Maharashtra in-charge Ramesh Chennithala who delegated responsibilities to regional leaders before the Lok Sabha elections and directed them to focus their efforts only in the areas assigned to them.

On Thursday evening, as part of the investigation into alleged financial irregularities at the hospital, the agency arrested Ashish Pandey, a doctor, a former staffer of R G Kar and a TMC Youth Wing member. The junior doctors who have been leading protests over the rape and murder at R G Kar, and demanding an overhaul in the running of the government hospital, have accused Pandey of being the kingpin of “the threat culture” at R G Kar. They have also accused him of regularly harassing junior doctors. A junior doctor of R G Kar told The Indian Express: “Pandey is the main man after Sandip Ghosh who is the root of all the corruption and threat culture (at the Medical College and Hospital). In government medical colleges, qualifying for a house staff position is very tough, but Pandey got that opportunity twice because of the unlimited influence he has within the state health system.” Don't miss | RG Kar case opens Pandora’s box, complaints pour in from Bengal’s key medical colleges Asked about Pandey and whether they were planning any action against him, Trinamool Chhatra Parishad (TMCP) state president Trinankur Bhattacharya said, “He was not our leader, not even a prominent face. He may be a general member of the TMCP. There are thousands of members like Pandey in the TMCP. So, what step will we take against him!” On September 25, when Pandey was summoned by the disciplinary committee of R G Kar for questioning, he was accosted by the protesting junior doctors. An alumni of R G Kar who now works as associate professor at its hospital agreed with the allegations of the junior doctors, recalling the time Pandey and his team “forcefully closed the alumni office and physically heckled former students”, allegedly at the best of then R G Kar principal Sandip Ghosh. “They also filed an FIR against us. Instead of taking steps against Pandey and his team, police harassed us.” Former TMC MP Santanu Sen, who has been critical of the party’s handling of the R G Kar episode, said Pandey’s arrest was not surprising. “This famous Ashish Pandey was the hero of corruption of various orders, including intimidating juniors, extorting money in the name of festivals, controlling who failed and cleared exams, leaking questions, ragging in hostels, illegally providing house staff positions, beating senior doctors, and locking the office of the alumni association.” Sen also accused Pandey of running a personal campaign against his daughter, a student at R G Kar, and him. “Pandey tried to tarnish my image, campaigned against me. They circulated false posters in my name, and came to beat me.” The CBI first interrogated Pandey over alleged financial irregularities at R G Kar, along with other TMC doctor leaders such as Avik Dey and Birupaksha Biswas. Before Pandey, the CBI had arrested Sandip Ghosh, who was the principal of R G Kar when the rape and murder happened, and three others in connection with its investigation into alleged financial irregularities.","category":"politics"},{"publishedAt":"2024-10-07","title":"Now bulldozers ‘with love’: Congress took a unique ride in riot-hit Nuh","description":"For Congress, and to some extent INLD, bulldozers served multiple purposes this election – they towered above all, they excited crowds, and sent a message “against BJP politics”","urlToImage":"https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/10/congress-nuh.jpg?w=640","content":"Two bulldozers stand on either side of the Delhi-Alwar road, their arms outstretched.

Riots had broken out in Nuh on July 31, 2023, during a VHP ‘Brajmandal Yatra’, leaving six, including two Bajrang Dal leaders, a Nuh resident, a Muslim cleric and two home guards, dead. Between August 3 and August 7, as per estimates of district authorities, 443 structures were demolished in Nuh district, including 162 permanent ones. Nearly 80% of those affected in the demolitions were Muslim. The Punjab and Haryana High Court later stayed the demolitions, taking suo motu cognizance of media reports and asking the government whether properties of “a particular community” were targeted “under the guise of a law and order problem”, and if an “exercise of ethnic cleansing” was being conducted.

(Express photo by Abhinav Saha) In Nuh, while the Congress took the lead in trying to send a counter message with bulldozers in the election campaign, the INLD did it too, though on a much smaller scale. Around the same time as Congress supporters were being showered with petals by bulldozers in Nuh on Thursday, INLD Ferozepur Jhirka candidate Mohammad Habib was being welcomed similarly with currency notes elsewhere in the district. Congress worker Abrar Numberdar of Ferozepur Jhirka said: “Yogi baba (Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath) has used bulldozers to raze homes. We want to demonstrate that it could be used to show love too.” Another worker, Kadir Khan, said that earlier, during the Lok Sabha elections, bulldozers had been used to shower petals on Congress Gurgaon candidate Raj Babbar. “Kanoon ka istemal karo, bulldozer ka nahin (Follow the course of law, not bulldozer),” added Khan. “The BJP governments in UP, Haryana and Rajasthan have only used it against Dalits, the poor and Muslims. We have yet to see the demolition of a rich criminal’s house. Like Rahulji says, ‘Nafrat ka jawab mohabbat se (Answer hate with love)’.” The Congress’s sitting MLA and candidate from Nuh, Aftab Ahmed, said the BJP used bulldozers as “a weapon of power to demolish the homes of SCs and Muslims”. “By our action, we are countering their politics. Recently, the Supreme Court also took up this matter. Our government won’t go against the law and demolish people’s homes based on their caste or religion.” Congress supporters at the party’s campaign event in Nuh. (Express photo by Abhinav Saha) He said it was the statement of Baba Balaknath, the BJP MLA from Tijara in Rajasthan, that he would undertake “bulldozer justice” against Mewati Muslims in Alwar that prompted them to mount this counter campaign. INLD Ferozepur Jhirka candidate Mohammad Habib acknowledged the popularity of bulldozers for campaigning in Mewat. But while slamming the BJP for its “bulldozer justice”, he said that more than this, the USP of bulldozers was that “they are bigger than any other machine”. During the campaign, the Nuh riots were a recurring issue, with candidates blaming each other for the flare-up and the state action in its wake. The Congress has repeated all its sitting MLAs in the elections, including in the three seats of the Nuh district – Nuh, Ferozepur Jhirka and Punhana. Among them is Mamman Khan from Ferozepur Jhirka, who was arrested last year for the riots. Given bail in four cases in October 2023, Mamman Khan was slapped with the UAPA earlier this year. Recently, the Haryana Police approached the High Court seeking cancellation of his bail. Don't miss | Haryana contests have been getting tighter, with Congress closing gap to BJP Among those present at Gandhi’s rally in Nuh on Thursday was Aas Mohammad, who came with his own two bulldozers, which he has had since 1999. After the riots, as police started rounding up people, Mohammad said he left the area. “The houses and shops of many innocent people were demolished by PWD bulldozers. It took months for things to come back to normal.” However, he asserted, that was not why he loaned his bulldozers for the rally, nor did he “read too much” into why parties wanted to use these to shower petals. “People get enthused at their sight… Tractors have been in use for decades and bulldozers can get you higher than any other vehicle. When there are no homes to climb atop, bulldozers come in handy,” he reasoned. Plus, political rallies and meetings are becoming more active and bustling, he said. “Those aged 10 to 80 attend now.” Still, he did have one motivation, Mohammad said. “I didn’t get paid for the use of the bulldozers and, in fact, incurred expenses of Rs 1,000-1,500 a day. But I was fine with that. We need the Congress to win, and I am doing what I can to help.” Mohammad Farid, an MA student at Jhansi who was one of those atop Mohammad’s bulldozers, said: “Since the Model Code of Conduct was in place, there have not been many projects where bulldozers were deployed. So the owners started giving them for campaigning. This was an idea of the Mewatis. Now everyone is noticing us.”","category":"politics"},{"publishedAt":"2024-10-07","title":"Haryana contests have been getting tighter, with Congress closing gap to BJP","description":"After 10 years in power, the BJP saw its seat tally drop in recent Lok Sabha as Congress shows a resurgence","urlToImage":"https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/10/haryana.jpg?w=640","content":"The Haryana Assembly elections are set to conclude with voting across all 90 seats, including 17 reserved for Scheduled Castes (SCs), on Saturday. Initially scheduled to be held on October 1, along with the last phase of the Jammu and Kashmir Assembly polls, voting was deferred in Haryana by the Election Commission citing the Bishnoi community’s Amavasya festival and the long weekend around Gandhi Jayanti. While the primary contest is between the ruling BJP and Congress, the state’s alliance dynamics has seen a churn. Ahead of the Lok Sabha polls, the BJP ended its tie-up with the Dushyant Chautala-led Jannayak Janta Party (JJP), which has now allied with Chandrashekhar Azad’s Aazad Samaj Party. While the Opposition INDIA bloc partners Congress and the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) had struck a seat-sharing deal for the general elections, they were unable to come to an agreement for the Assembly polls. And the O P Chautala-led Indian National Lok Dal (INLD) is contesting with the Mayawati-led BSP. The BJP is hoping for a third consecutive term, having won an outright majority in 2014 and partnered with the JJP in 2019 to form a coalition government. The Congress’s last stint in power was also for two terms, between 2005 and 2014. Decode Politics | Why BJP ‘damaad’, ‘dalaal’ noise against Congress in Haryana rings a bit hollow In the 2014 Assembly polls, after the “Modi wave” Lok Sabha election, the BJP had ended the Congress’s decade-long run under former Chief Minister Bhupinder Hooda to form a government in Haryana for the first time. With a 33.3% vote share and 47 seats – enough to clear the 46-seat majority mark – the BJP came to power with Manohar Lal Khattar as the CM. The INLD was the next largest party with 19 seats and 24.2% vote share, followed by the Congress at 15 and 20.7%. But in 2019, despite having swept all the 10 seats in the preceding Lok Sabha polls, the BJP fell short of a majority in the Assembly elections in Haryana, with 40 seats – though its vote share rose to 36.5%. The JJP, making its Assembly poll debut after breaking away from the INLD in 2018, proved kingmaker with its 10 seats and 14.8% vote share, and allied with the BJP to form a coalition government. The Congress won 31 seats and a 28.1% vote share to become the primary Opposition. The INLD, though, fell to just one seat and 2.4% vote share. The recently concluded Lok Sabha polls saw the BJP further lose ground – dropping from all 10 in 2019 to five. The 2024 Lok Sabha data extrapolated to the Assembly segment level suggests the state could see a hung House this time. At the Assembly segment level – each Lok Sabha constituency contains several Assembly constituencies – the BJP won the most votes in 44 of Haryana’s total 90 Assembly seats. The Congress was not far behind at 42, with the AAP leading in the remaining four seats. The JJP and INLD did not lead in any Assembly segment.

On Saturday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi will be visiting the state for the second time within a fortnight, making halts in the politically crucial regions of Vidarbha and Mumbai-Thane. Like his September 20 visit, Modi will be unveiling mega infrastructure projects and pushing welfare schemes during his Saturday visit. The trip will include a tour of the Jagdamba Mata Temple, Poharadevi, in Washim, an important pilgrimage centre of the Banjara community, halts at samadhis of two local saints, and the inauguration of a ‘Banjara Virasat Museum’. A nomadic tribe, the Banjaras number over a crore, constituting a sizeable vote bank in parts of Vidarbha, North Maharashtra and Marathwada regions. The BJP’s push for the Banjara vote follows the erosion of support for it among the Dalits and Kunbis. While the Congress successfully wooed the Dalits in the Lok Sabha polls talking of a “threat to the Constitution”, the Kunbis are angry with the BJP-led Mahayuti government over the confusion on the Maratha quota issue. Don't miss | Why cow is back on Maharashtra Cabinet table, ‘love, vote jihad’ on Dy CM Fadnavis lips The BJP is hoping that the two-pronged strategy of pushing a development agenda and balancing micro caste and community interests will help it in the polls. Vidarbha accounts for 62 of the 288 Assembly seats in Maharashtra. In 2014, the party had almost swept Vidarbha, winning 44 of its seats, on road to its Maharashtra win. In 2019, when the BJP could not get a simple majority, its tally was 29 in Vidarbha. Earlier, Union Home Minister Amit Shah began its series of pre-poll Maharashtra election meetings with Vidarbha. The BJP has also brought to Vidarbha a unit from Madhya Pradesh that successfully worked with former chief minister and current Union Agriculture Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan during the state polls, which saw the BJP return to power. Sources said they have held interactions with local leaders across 11 districts in Vidarbha and given their inputs to the central poll management team on drawing a segment-wise plan to reach out to people in the region, as well as to take populist schemes like Ladli Bahin Yojna to the people. The projects which Modi will unveil in Vidarbha include initiatives related to the agricultural and animal husbandry sector, worth around Rs 23,300 crore. The PM will also disburse the 18th instalment of the PM-KISAN Samman Nidhi worth about Rs 20,000 crore to around 9.4 crore farmers, and the 5th instalment of NaMo Shetkari Mahasanman Nidhi Yojana amounting to about Rs 2,000 crore. During his September visit, Modi had commemorated the first anniversary of ‘Vishwakarma Yojna’ in Vidarbha by handing over loan certificates to 18 beneficiaries in 18 different trades. He also inaugurated a PM MITRA Park for the textile sector. Mumbai with 36 seats and Thane with 24 make up another 60 seats. The PM’s push here – on the back of significant infrastructure projects under the BJP government in 2014-19 – is significant as Eknath Shinde of the Shiv Sena considers the region its bastion. On Saturday, Modi is to inaugurate other projects, including several involving the Mumbai Metro.","category":"politics"},{"publishedAt":"2024-10-07","title":"Decode Politics: Why BJP ‘damaad’, ‘dalaal’ noise against Congress in Haryana rings a bit hollow","description":"Party has been attacking Robert Vadra and former CM Bhupinder Hooda over a land deal since 2014. But its govt told HC in 2023 that “no violations were detected”, its ex-CM Khattar said in July “matter does not invite a jail term”","urlToImage":"https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/10/vadra-decode.jpg?w=640","content":"One of the main lines of attack in the BJP’s campaign against the Congress in Haryana in recent past has been charges against Robert Vadra. Ahead of the 2014 Assembly elections, the BJP had widely circulated a booklet called “Damaad-Shri” and also released a campaign film on the charges. This time too, all through the campaign for the October 5 Haryana Assembly elections, senior BJP leaders targeted Vadra, Priyanka Gandhi Vadra’s husband and Sonia Gandhi’s son-in-law. Addressing a rally in Sonipat on September 25, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said that under the Congress governments headed by Bhupinder Singh Hooda (2004-14), the state had been handed over to “damaad (son-in-law) and dalaals (middlemen)”. On Thursday, on the last day of campaigning, Hooda countered the BJP, accusing it of “spreading false propaganda that Robert Vadra was given land by the Haryana government”. “The Congress government did not give even an inch of government land to Robert Vadra. If the BJP shows proof (to the contrary), I will quit politics,” he said. What is the BJP’s reference to? In February 2008, when Hooda was the Haryana CM, Skylight Hospitality, a company launched by Vadra in 2007 with a capital of Rs 1 lakh, bought about 3.5 acres of land in Manesar-Shikohpur in Gurgaon from Onkareshwar Properties for Rs 7.5 crore. The plot was mutated in favour of Skylight the next day, and the title of the land transferred to Vadra within 24 hours of the purchase. This process usually takes at least three months. Also in Political Pulse | Ashok Tanwar turns again: Canvasses for BJP in afternoon, in Congress hours later A month later, the Haryana government gave Skylight Hospitality permission to develop a housing project on most of the land. This led to an immediate increase in the value of the land. In June 2008, DLF agreed to buy the plot for Rs 58 crore – which meant that in just a few months, the value of Vadra’s property had increased by close to 700%. The payment was made to Vadra in instalments, and by 2012, the mutation transferring the colony licence on the land to DLF was over. Soon after, in October 2012, senior IAS officer Ashok Khemka cancelled the mutation of the plot on the grounds that the assistant consolidation officer, who had sanctioned it, was “not competent” to do so. Khemka, who was the Director General, Consolidation of Holdings and Land Records-cum-Inspector General of Registration, was transferred from the department hours later. What is the status of the deal? On September 1, 2018, the Gurugram police registered a criminal case against Hooda, Vadra and others under Sections 420 (cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property), 467 (forgery of valuable security, will), 468 (forgery for purpose of cheating), 471 (using a forged document or electronic record as genuine) and 120-B (criminal conspiracy) of the IPC and Section 13 of the Prevention of Corruption Act (criminal misconduct by a public servant). However, in April 2023, the Haryana government informed the Punjab and Haryana High Court that “no violation of rules or regulations have been detected in the transfer of land by Ms Skylight Hospitality to DLF Universal Limited in Gurgram”. Don't miss | Why PM Modi keeps bringing up a caste clash of 14 years ago in Haryana The Haryana government said this through an affidavit to a Bench that was suo motu hearing a matter pertaining to pendency of cases against sitting and former MPs and MLAs in Punjab, Haryana and Union Territory of Chandigarh. Has the BJP government in the state taken any action in the matter? The BJP has been in power in Haryana since 2014. In 10 years and across two governments, its government has not prosecuted either Vadra or the DLF for the land deal. In July, former Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar virtually absolved Vadra of any illegality saying that “the matter does not invite a jail term”. Now the Union Minister of Housing and Urban Affairs, he said at a press briefing in Jaipur: “There is no such illegality in the matter (land transaction) that action has to be taken against someone to put them in jail… We do not get inquiries conducted with the aim of sending our opponents to jail.” Adding that an inquiry had indicated that “there was a variation in the sale and purchase price of the land, which raised suspicion that someone profited from it”, Khattar said: “There could at best be non-criminal action like imposition of penalty or reverting of the land.” Hooda has accused the BJP of destroying a “farmer-friendly land acquisition policy” implemented in Haryana and the entire country under Congress governments in the state and the Centre. “We implemented floor rates for land in the entire state. Before this, the INLD and BJP had together looted farmers in the name of land acquisition. The Congress implemented the rule that royalty would be given for 33 years on land acquisition, but the BJP did not give even that to farmers.” What has been Vadra’s reaction? With the BJP attacking him constantly during the campaign, Vadra said on September 26: “I am quite surprised that once again the Prime Minister has used my name. They have had their own government in Haryana as well as at the Centre. In the last decade, they have set up commissions. The Dhingra commission was set up to conduct an inquiry into my companies and me. There were RTIs to check how much land I have in Haryana. We have had notices of all sorts. Whatever works that we were doing in Haryana were stopped. Whichever companies I dealt with had notices sent. So they have done everything in the last decade to try and disrupt any kind of work… Nothing was proven. They cannot prove anything because there were no wrongdoings in the way my companies functioned.” Vadra also accused the BJP of raising the issue to distract attention from its own government’s failures.","category":"politics"},{"publishedAt":"2024-10-07","title":"Prashant Kishor’s ‘clarity of vision’, ‘talk of equality’ motivated me, says party working president","description":"Former IFS officer Manoj Bharati says always remained connected to Bihar roots, never intended to join politics","urlToImage":"https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/10/PK_20241004050938.jpeg?w=640","content":"MANOJ BHARATI, the working president of the newly launched Jan Suraaj Party in Bihar, first got associated with Prashant Kishor when the latter launched his padyatra from Bhitiharwa in West Champaran on October 2, 2022. The retired Indian Foreign Service (IFS) officer says he had no idea till a month ago that Kishor, the political analyst-turned-politician, would zero in on him for the post, from among the many ex-IPS officers, doctors, advocates and IITians in its ranks. Announcing Bharati as the working president on Wednesday, Kishor said Jan Suraaj would hold its organisational elections in March 2025, and till then Bharati would be the party’s working president. He would be made full-fledged president if duly elected, Kishor said. If Bharati, who belongs to Madhubani, is picked, as expected, he would be the key face of Jan Suraaj when it makes its electoral debut with the Bihar Assembly elections of October-November 2025. More than the fact that Bharati is a Scheduled Caste, his accomplishments influenced the decision to pick him as working president, Kishor said. “I tried to get enrolled in Netarhat twice, but could not succeed. Here is Manoj Bharati, who studied at Netarhat, Ranchi,” Kishor said, in a reference to Netarhat’s reputed boarding school. He went on to mention Bharati’s career graph since, including B.Tech from IIT-Kanpur and Masters from IIT-Delhi, before becoming an IFS officer. As a bureaucrat, Bharati served as Secretary (Administration) in the Ministry of External Affairs, and was India’s envoy to Belarus, Indonesia, Ukraine and Timor Leste. Also read | Will end liquor ban in 15 minutes if Jan Suraaj Party comes to power, use revenue for education: Kishor In his speech, Bharati thanked Kishor for naming him the first occupant of the post and said he decided to join politics impressed by “the clarity of Kishor’s vision”. He never lost touch with his roots in Bihar, even when on foreign assignment, he said. “Whether it was gifting Mithila paintings or Bhagalpuri silk shawls to guests, it was all about showcasing Bihar.” In an interview to The Indian Express, Bharati added: “There is a ‘cooling-off’ period of one year after retirement, after which I was looking for options. I was interested in doing some work in the field of education and training of youths, and politics was never on the radar. But I always had this social awareness and desire to give back to society.” Bharati credited some of this to his late father-in-law and former Bihar DGP Maiku Ram, who also made a name in politics. “Even now people all over Bihar remember him. Then I met PK (Kishor). He convinced me that the usual notion of money, muscle and ancestry is not relevant in his way of doing politics. That is when I decided to work with him.” Recalling fondly his trips back home to the family village to meet his cousins, Bharati said these showed him that the two things that need “immediate attention” are education and employment. “Though these are just two words, they are connected to many aspects of governance.” In his speech after being named working president, Bharati named finding a solution to recurrent floods in Bihar as another of Jan Suraaj’s goals. “We are in touch with experts to ensure that rivers remain friends and do not turn into enemies… Our common goal is to make Bihar one of the top 10 states of the country.” Kishor earlier said that his party would ensure proportional representation to all social groups, and that its president, whose term would last a year, would be an SC to start with, followed by an EBC or a Muslim, and then OBC and a general category candidate. Bharati told The Indian Express that this was a big thing. “PK speaks of the need for equal status and opportunities to various sections of society. He has declared special programmes for women, old citizens, farmers. His talk of proportional representation for Dalits, backward classes, Muslims and other higher castes has been accepted as a fundamental principle of Jan Suraaj by the masses and people in the party.”","category":"politics"},{"publishedAt":"2024-10-07","title":"In Delhi, BJP game plan against AAP: graft, ‘misgovernance’ plank to wresting ‘swing seats’","description":"At Ranthambore “Chintan Baithak” on Delhi polls, BJP state and central leaders also made a pitch for unity and coordination within party ranks","urlToImage":"https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/10/cats.jpg?w=640","content":"Gearing up to take on the ruling Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) in the Delhi Assembly elections due in February 2025, the BJP is set to use corruption allegations against the AAP dispensation along with its alleged inability to deliver “effective governance” as its poll plank. While focusing on “swing seats”, the BJP would also make attempts to ensure proper cohesion and coordination within its ranks in Delhi, where the party has been out of power since 1998. These are part of the poll strategies firmed up by the Delhi BJP at a “Chintan Baithak” held in Rajasthan’s Ranthambore during 28-29 September. The meeting, chaired by Delhi BJP president Virendra Sachdeva, was attended by the entire city unit brass including party general secretary (organisation) Pawan Rana, all seven Lok Sabha MPs and all seven MLAs. Senior BJP leaders including party national general secretary (organisation) B L Santhosh, national general secretary Dushyant Gautam and Delhi BJP co-incharge Alka Gurjar were also attended this brainstorming session. Former MPs Harsh Vardhan, Parvesh Verma and Ramesh Bidhuri also participated in the meeting. Decode Politics | Delhi Assembly nears end of year without Question Hour. Why the practice is important The BJP central leadership is understood to have told the party MPs to “lead the party’s revival bid “from the front” in the national capital, where it has not been able to win the Assembly polls for the last six consecutive times. “Coordination and putting up a united front were among the key issues which came up for discussion. The leaders present there (at Chintan Baithak) were told to let go of internal disagreements and ensure that any bickerings among each other over any issue does not surface in public,” a BJP source said. “One of the reasons why the meeting was held in Rajasthan was to ensure that these leaders, who will be both the backbone as well as the faces of the party’s poll campaign, learn to increasingly work together by staying together. This was the second such retreat for these leaders after one in Vrindavan a few weeks ago,” the source said, adding that such an interaction between the party’s state and senior leaders, including the organisational representatives from the RSS, “usually occur closer to elections”. According to a senior BJP leader, some participants proposed that “new faces” should be given an opportunity in about 20 Assembly seats, where the party has been fielding the same candidates despite their repeated losses in past elections. Some other leaders called for “taking the issue related to the administrative and governance problems directly to the people instead of only backing Lt Governor V K Saxena over them”. Also read | With cutouts, BJP launches campaign against potholes in Delhi In a statement, Sachdeva said all the leaders present at the meeting “were unanimous in their view” that the Delhi people “are fed up with corruption and inefficiency of the Aam Aadmi Party”, adding that it was reflected in the 2024 Lok Sabha election results which saw the BJP sweeping all seven seats in the capital, leading in 52 Assembly segments out of 70, including eight reserved for the Scheduled Castes (SCs). “A collective decision was made in the Chintan Baithak to contest the 2025 Assembly elections with the goal of performing better than the Lok Sabha elections,” Sachdeva stated. This, according to a senior BJP leader, essentially meant that the party would seek to strengthen its fortunes especially in “about eight to 10 Assembly seats” where it was left behind by the AAP-Congress combine by “low vote margins” in the Lok Sabha polls. For instance, in the North East Delhi Lok Sabha constituency won by the BJP’s Manoj Tiwari, he trailed behind the Congress’s Kanhaiya Kumar in the Seemapuri Assembly seat by about 5,500 votes. East Delhi’s Jangpura segment saw the AAP’s Kuldeep Kumar lead by about 2,500 votes, even as the BJP’s Harsh Malhotra bagged the parliamentary seat by over 93,000 votes. Similarly, the BJP’s Bansuri Swaraj trounced the AAP’s Somnath Bharti in the New Delhi Lok Sabha constituency by over 78,000 vote, but the latter took a lead in the Delhi Cantonment Assembly segment by around 1,200 votes, New Delhi seat by about 2,200 votes, and the RK Puram seat by 912 votes. In West Delhi bagged by the BJP’s Kamaljeet Sehrawat, the AAP’s Mahabal Mishra led in the Rajouri Garden segment by 2,446 votes and the Hari Nagar seat by 2,164 votes. In South Delhi won by the BJP’s Ramvir Singh Bidhuri, the AAP’s Sahi Ram had a lead in the Ambedkar Nagar segment by 804 votes, Sangam Vihar seat by 1,838 votes and the Tughlakabad segment by 5,128 votes.
